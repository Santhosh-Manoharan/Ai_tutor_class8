Crop Production and Management", "content": "CROP PRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT CROP PRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT Paheli and Boojho went to their uncles house during the summer vacation. Their uncle is a far mer. One day they saw some tools like khurpi , sickle, shovel, plough, etc., in the field. In order to provide food for a large population regular production, proper management and distribution is necessary. 1.1Agricultural Practices Till 10,000 B.C.E. people wer e nomadic. They were wandering in groups from place to place in search of food and shelter . They ate raw fruits and vegetables and started hunting animals for food. Later , they could cultivate land and produce rice, wheat and other food crops. Thus, was born Agriculture. When plants of the same kind are cultivated at one place on a large scale, it is called a crop. For example, crop of wheat means that all the plants grown in a field are that of wheat. You alr eady know that cr ops ar e of different types like cereals, vegetables and fruits. These can be classified on the basis of the season in which they grow. India is a vast country. The climatic conditions like temperature, humidity and rainfall vary from one region to another . Accordingly, ther e is a richYou have lear nt that all living organisms require food. Plants can make their food themselves. Can you recall how green plants synthesise their own food? Animals including humans can not make their own food. So, where do animals get their food from? But, first of all why do we have to eat food? You alr eady know that ener gy from the food is utilised by organisms for carrying out their various body functions, such as digestion, respiration and excr etion. W e get our food fr om plants, or animals, or both. Since we all need food, how can we provide food to a large number of people in our country?Food has to be produced on a large scale. I want to know where and how we use these tools. 2024-25 SCIENCE 2variety of crops grown in different parts of the country. Despite this diversity, two broad cropping patterns can be identified. These are: (i) Kharif Crops : The crops which are sown in the rainy season are called kharif crops. The rainy season in India is generally fr om June to September . Paddy, maize, soyabean, groundnut and cotton are kharif crops. (ii) Rabi Crops : The crops grown in the winter season (October to March) are called rabi crops. Examples of rabi crops are wheat, gram, pea, mustard and linseed. Besides these, pulses and vegetables are grown during summer at many places. 1.2Basic Practices of Crop Productionto as agricultural practices which are listed below: (i)Preparation of soil (ii)Sowing (iii)Adding manure and fertilisers (iv)Irrigation (v)Protecting from weeds (vi)Harvesting (vii)Storage 1.3 Preparation of Soil The preparation of soil is the first step before growing a crop. One of the most important tasks in agriculture is to turn the soil and loosen it. This allows the roots to penetrate deep into the soil. The loose soil allows the roots to breathe easily even when they go deep into the soil. Why does the loosening of soil allow the roots to breathe easily? The loosened soil helps in the growth of earthworms and microbes present in the soil. These organisms are friends of the farmer since they further turn and loosen the soil and add humus to it. But why the soil needs to be turned and loosened? You have lear nt in the pr evious classes that soil contains minerals, water , air and some living organisms. In addition, dead plants and animals get decomposed by soil organisms. In this way, various nutrients in the dead organisms are released back into the soil. These nutrients are again absorbed by plants. Since only a few centimetres of the top layer of soil supports plant growth, turning and loosening of soil brings the nutrient-rich soil to the top so that plants can use these nutrients. Thus,Why paddy can not be grown in the winter season? Paddy requires a lot of water . Ther efore, it is gr own only in the rainy season. Cultivation of crops involves several activities undertaken by farmers over a period of time. Y ou may find that these activities are similar to those carried out by a gardener or even by you when you grow ornamental plants in your house. These activities or tasks are referred 2024-25 CROP PRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT 3turning and loosening of soil is very important for cultivation of crops. The process of loosening and turning of the soil is called tilling or ploughing . This is done by using a plough. Ploughs are made of wood or iron. If the soil is very dry, it may need watering before ploughing. The ploughed field may have big clumps of soil called crumbs. It is necessary to break these crumbs. Levelling the field is beneficial for sowing as well as for irrigation. Levelling of soil is done with the help of a leveller . Sometimes, manure is added to the soil before tilling. This helps in proper mixing of manure with soil. The soil is moistened before sowing. Agricultural Implements Before sowing the seeds, it is necessary to break soil clumps to get better yield. This is done with the help of various tools. The main tools used for this purpose are the plough, hoe and cultivator .Plough : This is being used since ancient times for tilling the soil, adding fertili sers to the crop, removing the weeds and turning the soil. This is made of wood and is drawn by a pair of bulls or other animals (horses and camels) . It contains a strong triangular iron strip called ploughshare. The main part of the plough is a long log of wood which is called a ploughshaft. There is a handle at one end of the shaft. The other end is attached to a beam which is placed on the bulls necks. One pair of bulls and a man can easily operate the plough [Fig. 1.1 (a)]. The indigenous wooden plough is increasingly being replaced by iron ploughs nowadays. Hoe : It is a simple tool which is used for removing weeds and for loosening the soil. It has a long rod of wood or iron. A strong, broad and bent plate of iron is fixed to one of its ends and Fig. 1.1 (a) : The plough ploughshaft ploughsharebeam 2024-25 SCIENCE 4Activity 1.1 Take a beaker and fill half of it with water . Put a handful of wheat seeds and stir well. Wait for some time. Are there seeds which float on water? W ould those be lighter or heavier than those which sink? Why would they be lighter? Damaged seeds become hollow and ar e thus lighter . Therefore, they float o n water . This is a good method for separating good, healthy seeds from the damaged ones. Before sowing , one of the important tasks is to know about the tools used for sowing seeds [Fig. 1.2 (a), (b)]. Traditional tool : The tool used traditionally for sowing seeds is shaped like a funnel [Fig. 1.2 (a)]. The seeds are filled into the funnel, passed down through two or three pipes having sharp ends. These ends pierce into the soil and place seeds there.Cultivator : Nowadays ploughing is done by tractor -driven cultivator . The use of cultivator saves labour and time. [Fig. 1.1 (c)]. Fig. 1.1 (b) : A hoe Fig. 1.2 (a) : Traditional method of sowing Fig. 1.1 (c) : Cultivator driven by a tractor 1.4 Sowing Sowing is an important part of crop production. Before sowing, good quality, clean and healthy seeds of a good variety are selected. Farmers prefer to use seeds which give high yield. Selection of Seedsgrip beam bent plate rodhandle One day I saw my mother put some gram seeds in a vessel and pour some water on them. After a few minutes some seeds started to float on top. I wonder why some seeds float on water!works like a blade. It is pulled by animals [Fig. 1.1 (b)]. 2024-25 CROP PRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT 5Seed drill : Nowadays the seed drill [Fig. 1.2 (b)] is used for sowing with the help of tractors. This sows the seeds uniformly at equal distance and depth. It ensures that seeds get covered by the soil after sowing. This protects seeds from being eaten by birds. Sowing by using a seed drill saves time and labour .Fig. 1.2 (b) : A seed drill There is a nursery near my school. I found that little plants were kept in small bags. Why are they kept like this? Seeds of a few plants such as paddy are first grown in a nursery. When they grow into seedlings, they are transplanted to the field manually. Some forest plants and flowering plants are also grown in the nursery. Appropriate distance between the seeds is necessary to avoid overcrowding of plants. This allows plants to get I saw a healthy crop growing in a farm. In the neighbouring farm, the plants were weak. Why do some plants grow better than others?sufficient sunlight, nutrients and water from the soil. At times a few plants may have to be removed to prevent overcrowding. 1.5Adding Manure and Fertilisers The substances which are added to the soil in the form of nutrients for the healthy growth of plants are called manure and fertilisers . Soil supplies mineral nutrients to the crop plants. These nutrients are essential for the growth of plants. In certain areas, farmers grow crop after crop in the same field. The field is never left uncultivated or fallow. Imagine what happens to the nutrients? Continuous cultivation of crops makes the soil poor in nutrients. Therefore, farmers have to add manure to the fields to replenish the soil with nutrients. This process is called manuring . Improper or insufficient manuring results in weak plants. Manure is an organic substance obtained from the decomposition of plant or animal wastes. Farmers dump plant and animal waste in pits at open places and allow it to decompose. The decomposition is caused by some microorganisms. The decomposed matter is used as organic manure. You have alr eady lear nt about vermicomposting in Class VI. 2024-25 SCIENCE 6Activity 1.2 Take moong or gram seeds and germinate them. Select three equal sized seedlings . Take three empty glasses or similar vessels. Mark them A, B and C. To glass A add little amount of soil mixed with a little cow dung manure. In glass B put the same amount of soil mixed with a little urea. Take the s a me amount of soil in glass C without adding anything [Fig. 1.3(a)]. Now pour the same amount of water in each glass and plant the seedlings in them. Keep them in a safe place and water them daily . After 7 to 10 days observe their growth [Fig. 1.3(b)].better growth of plants? In which glass was the growth fastest? Fertilisers are chemical s which are rich in a particular nutrient. How are they different from manure? Fertilisers are produced in factories. Some examples of fertilisers are  urea, ammonium sulphate, super phosphate, potash, NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium). The use of fertilisers has helped farmers to get better yield of crops such as wheat, paddy and maize. But excessive use of fertilisers has made the soil less fertile. Fertilisers have also become a source of water pollution. Therefore, in order to maintain the fertility of the soil, we have to substitute fertilisers with organic manure or leave the field uncultivated (fallow) in between two crops. The use of manure improves soil texture as well as its water retaining capacity. It replenishes the soil with nutrients. Another method of replenishing the soil with nutrients is through crop rotation . This can be done by growing different crops alter nately. Earlier , farmers in northern India used to grow legumes as fodder in one season and wheat in the next season. This helped in the replenishment of the soil with nitrogen. Farmers are being encouraged to adopt this practice. In the previous classes, you have learnt about Rhizobium bacteria. These are present in the nodules of roots of leguminous plants. They fix atmospheric nitrogen. Fig. 1.3 (a) : Preparation of the experiment Did plants in all the glasses grow at the same pace? Which glass showed Fig. 1.3 (b) :Growing seedlings with manure and fertiliser 2024-25 CROP PRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT 7 Table 1.1 gives the differences between a fertili ser and manure. Advantages of Manure : The organic manure is considered better than fertilisers. This is because circle6it enhances the water holding capacity of the soil. circle6it makes the soil porous due to which exchange of gases becomes easy. circle6it increases the number of friendly microbes. circle6it improves the texture of the soil. 1.6 Irrigation All living beings need water to live. Water is important for pr oper gr owth and development. W ater is absorbed by the plant r oots. Along with water , minerals and fertilisers are also absorbed. Plants contain nearly 90 water . Water is essential because germination of seeds does not take place under dry conditions. Nutrients dissolved in water are transported to each part of the plant. W ater alsoprotects the crop from both frost and hot air currents. To maintain the moisture of the soil for healthy crop growth, fields have to be watered regularly. The supply of water to crops at regular intervals is called irrigation . The time and frequency of irrigation varies from crop to crop, soil to soil and season to season. In summer , the fr equency of watering is higher . Why is it so? Could it be due to the increased rate of evaporation of water from the soil and the leaves?Table 1.1 : Differences between Fertiliser and Manure S. No. Fertiliser Manure 1. Fertiliser is a man-made Manure is a natural substance obtained inorganic salt. by the decomposition of cattle dung and plant residues. 2.

Fertilisers are very rich in Manure is relatively less rich in plant plant nutrients like nitrogen, nutrients. phosphorus and potassium. Sources of irrigation : The sources of water for irrigation are wells, tubewells, ponds, lakes, rivers, dams and canals.I am very careful this year about watering the plants. Last summer my plants dried up and died. 2024-25 SCIENCE 8 Fig. 1.4 (a) : Moat Fig. 1.4 (b) : Chain pump Fig. 1.4 (d) : RahatFig. 1.4 (c) : DhekliTraditional Methods of Irrigation The water available in wells, lakes and canals is lifted up by different methods in different regions, for taking it to the fields. Cattle or human labour is used in these methods. So these methods ar e cheaper , but less efficient. The various traditional ways are: (i)moat (pulle y-system) (ii)chain pump (iii)dhekli, and (iv)rahat (Lever system) [Figs. 1.4 (a)- (d)]. Pumps are commonly used for lifting water . Diesel, biogas, electricity and solar energy is used to run these pumps. 2024-25 CROP PRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT 9Modern Methods of Irrigation Modern methods of irrigation help us to use water economically. The main methods used are as follows: (i)Sprinkler System: This system is more useful on the uneven land where sufficient water is not available. The perpendicular pipes, having rotating nozzles on top, are joined to the main pipeline at regular intervals. When water is allowed to flow through the main pipe under pressure with the help of a pump, it escapes from the rotating nozzles. It gets sprinkled on the crop as if it is raining. Sprinkler is very useful for lawns, coffee plantation and several other crops [Fig. 1.5 (a)]. Fig. 1.5 (b) : Drip System Fig. 1.5 (a) : Sprinkler system (ii)Drip system : In this system, the water falls drop by drop directly near the roots. So it is called drip system. It is the best technique for watering fruit plants, gardens and trees [Fig. 1.5(b)]. Water is not wasted at all. It is a boon in regions wher e availability of water is poor . 2024-25 SCIENCE 101.7 Pr otection fr om W eeds Boojho and Paheli went to a nearby wheat field and saw that there were some other plants in the field, growing along with wheat plants. Have these other plants been planted purposely? In a field many other undesirable plants may grow naturally along with the crop. These undesirable plants are called weeds . The removal of weeds is called weeding. W eeding is necessary since weeds compete with the crop plants for water , nutrients, space and light. Thus, they affect the growth of the crop. Some weeds inter fere even in harvesting and may be poisonous for animals and human beings. Farmers adopt many ways to remove weeds and contr ol their growth. T illing before sowing of crops helps in uprooting and killing of weeds, which may then dry up and get mixed with the soil. The best time for the removal of weeds is before they produce flowers and seeds. The manual removal includes physical removal of weeds by uprooting or cutting them close to the ground, from time to time. This is done with the help of a khurpi. A seed drill [Fig. 1.2(b)] is also used to uproot weeds. Weeds ar e also controlled by using certain chemicals, called weedicides , like 2,4-D. These are sprayed in the fields to kill the weeds. They do not damage the crops. The weedicides are diluted with water to the extent required and sprayed in the fields with a sprayer . (Fig. 1.6). Do weedicides have any effect on the person handling the weedicide sprayer?Fig. 1.6 : Spraying weedicide As already mentioned, the weedicides are sprayed during the vegetative growth of weeds before flowering and seed formation. Spraying of weedicides may affect the health of farmer s. So they should use these chemicals very carefully. They should cover their nose and mouth with a piece of cloth during spraying of these chemicals. 1.8Harvesting Harvesting of a crop is an important task. The cutting of crop after it is mature is called harvesting . In harvesting, crops are pulled out or cut close to the ground. It usually takes 3 to 4 months for a cereal crop to mature. Harvesting in our country is either done manually by sickle (Fig. 1.7) or by a machine called harvester . In the harvested crop, the grain seeds need to be separatedFig. 1.7 : Sickle 2024-25 CROP PRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT 11from the chaff. This process is called threshing . This is carried out with the help of a machine called combine which is in fact a harvester as well as a thresher (Fig. 1.8). Fig. 1.8 : Combine After harvesting, sometimes stubs are left in the field, which are burnt by farmers. Paheli is worried. She knows that it causes pollution. It may also catch fire and damage the crops lying in the fields. Harvest Festivals After three or four months of hard work there comes the day of the harvest. The sight of golden fields of standing crop, laden with grain, fills the hearts of farmers with joy and a sense of well -being. The efforts of the past season have borne fruit and it is time to relax and enjoy a little. The period of harvest is, thus, of great joy and happiness in all parts of India. Men and women celebrate it with great enthusiasm. Special festivals associated with the harvest season are Pongal, Baisakhi, Holi, Diwali, Nabanya and Bihu. 1.9Storage Storage of produce is an important task. If the harvested grains are to be kept for longer time, they should be safe from moisture, insects, rats and microorganisms. Harvested grains have more moisture. If freshly harvested grains (seeds) are stored without drying, they may get spoilt or attacked by organisms, making them unfit for use or for germination. Hence, before storing them, the grains are properly dried in the sun to reduce the moisture in them. This prevents the attack by insect pests, bacteria and fungi.Farmers with small holdings of land do the separation of grain and chaff by winnowing (Fig. 1.9). Y ou have alr eady studied this in Class VI. Fig. 1.9 : Winnowing machine I saw my mother putting some dried neem leaves in an iron drum containing wheat. I wonder why? 2024-25 SCIENCE 121.10 Food from Animals Fig. 1.10 (a) : Silos for storage of grains Fig. 1.10 (b) : Storage of grains in gunny bags in granaries Farmers store grains in jute bags or metallic bins. However , large scale storage of grains is done in silos and granaries to protect them from pests like rats and insects [Fig. 1.10 (a) and (b)]. Dried neem leaves are used for storing food grains at home. For storing large quantities of grains in big godowns, specific chemical treatments are required to protect them from pests and microorganisms.Activity 1.3 Make the following Table in your note book and complete it. S.No. Food Sources 1. Milk Cow, Buffalo, She- goat, She-camel . . . 2. 3. 4. Fish is good for health. We get cod liver oil fr om fish which is rich in vitamin D.After completing this Table, you must have seen that, like plants, animals also provide us with different kinds of food. Many people living in the coastal areas consume fish as a major part of their diet. In the previous classes you have learnt about the food that we obtain fr om plants. W e have just seen that the process of crop production involves a number of steps like selection of seeds, sowing, etc. Similarly, animals reared at home or in farms, have to be provided with proper food, shelter and care. When this is done on a large scale, it is called animal husbandry. 2024-25 CROP PRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT 13 KEYWORDSKEYWORDSKEYWORDSKEYWORDSKEYWORDS AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES ANIMAL HUSBANDRY CROP FERTILISER GRANARIES HARVESTING IRRIGA TION KHARIF MANURE PLOUGH RABI SEEDS SILO SOWING STORAGE THRESHING WEEDS WEEDICIDE WINNOWING WHA WHA WHA WHA WHA T YT YT Y T YT YOU HA OU HAOU HA OU HAOU HA VE LEARNTVE LEARNTVE LEARNTVE LEARNTVE LEARNT circlerightIn order to provide food to our growing population, we need to adopt certain agricultural practices. circlerightSame kind of plants cultivated at a place constitute a crop. circlerightIn India, crops can be broadly categorised into two types based on seasons - rabi and kharif crops. circlerightIt is necessary to prepare soil by tilling and levelling.

{"chapter": "2", "title": "Chapter 2: 2. Microorganisms", "content": "MICROORGANISMS : FRIEND AND FOE MICROORGANISMS : FRIEND AND FOE You have seen several kinds of plants and animals. However , there are other living organisms around us which we normally cannot see. These are called microorganisms or microbes . For example, you might have observed that during the rainy season moist bread gets spoilt and its surface gets cover ed with gr eyish white patches. Observe these patches through a magnifying glass. Y ou will see tiny, black rounded structures. Do you know what these structures are and where d o these come from? 2.1 Microorganisms Activity 2.1 Collect some moist soil from the field in a beaker and add water to it. After the soil particles have settled down , observe a drop of water from the beaker under a microscope. What do you see ? Activity 2.2 Take a few drops of water from a pond. Spread on a glass slide and observe through a microscope. Do you find tiny organisms moving around?These observations show that water and soil are full of tiny organisms, though not all of them fall into the category of microbes. These microorganisms or microbes are so small in size that they cannot be seen with the unaided eye. Some of these, such as the fungus that grows on bread, can be seen with a magnifying glass. Others cannot be seen without the help of a microscope. That is why these are called microorganisms or microbes. Microorganisms are classified into four major groups. These groups are bacteria , fungi , protozoa and some algae . Some of these common microorganisms are shown in Figs. 2.1 - 2.4. Viruses are also microscopic but are different from other microorganisms . They, however , reproduce only inside the cells of the host organism, which may be a bacterium, plant or animal. Some of the viruses are shown in Fig. 2.5. Common ailments like cold, influenza (flu) and most coughs are caused by viruses. Serious diseases like polio and chicken pox are also caused by viruses. Diseases like dysentery and malaria are caused by protozoa(protozoans) whereas typhoid and tuberculosis (TB) are bacterial diseases. You have lear nt about some of these microorganisms in Classes VI and VII. 2024-25 SCIENCE 18Fig. 2.4 : Fungi Fig. 2.1: Bacteria Chlamydomonas Spirogyra Fig. 2.2 : AlgaeAmoeba Paramecium Fig. 2.3 : Protozoa Bread mould PenicilliumAspergillus 2024-25 MICROORGANISMS : FRIEND AND FOE 192.2Where do Microorganisms Live? Microorganisms may be single-celled like bacteria, some algae and protozoa, or multicellular , such as many algae and fungi. They live in all types of environment, ranging from ice cold climate to hot springs; and deserts to marshy lands. They are also found inside the bodies of animals including humans. Some microorganisms grow on other organisms while others exist freely. 2.3 Microorganisms and Us Microorganisms play an important role in our lives. Some of them are beneficial in many ways whereas some others are harmful and cause diseases. Let us study about them in detail.Microorganisms have been used for the production of alcohol since ages.Friendly Microorganisms Microorganisms are used for various purposes. They are used in the preparation of curd, bread and cake. Curd contains several micro- organisms. Of these, the bacterium , Lactobacillus promotes the formation of curd. It multiplies in milk and converts it into curd. Bacteria are also involved in the making of cheese, pickles and many other food items. An important ingredient of rava (sooji) idlis and bhaturas is curd. Can you guess why? Bacteria and yeast are also helpful for fermentation of rice idlis and dosa batter . Fig. 2.5 : Viruses I saw that my mother added a little curd to warm milk to set curd for the next day. I wonder why?They are also used in cleaning up of the environment. For example, the organic wastes (vegetable peels, remains of animals, faeces , etc.) are broken down into harmless and usable substances by bacteria. Recall that bacteria are also used in the preparation of medicines. In agriculture they are used to increase soil fertility by fixing nitrogen. Making of Curd and Bread You have lear nt in Class VII that milk is turned into curd by bacteria. 2024-25 SCIENCE 20spoon of yeast powder to the sugar solution. Keep it covered in a warm place for 4-5 hours. Now smell the solution. Can you get a smell? Louis Pasteur discovered fermentation in 1857. In 1929, Alexander Fleming was working on a culture of disease- causing bacteria. Suddenly he found the spores of a little green mould in one of his culture plates. He observed that the presence of mould prevented the growth of bacteria. In fact, it also killed many of these bacteria. From this the mould penicillin was prepared. This is the smell of alcohol as sugar has been converted into alcohol by yeast. This process of conversion of sugar into alcohol is known as fermentation.Activity 2.3 Take \u00bd kg flour ( atta or maida ), add some sugar and mix with warm water . Add a small amount of yeast powder and knead to make a soft dough. What do you observe after two hours? Did you find the dough rising? Maida with yeast powder Raised maida Fig. 2.6 Yeast r eproduces rapidly and produces carbon dioxide during respiration. Bubbles of the gas fill the dough and increase its volume (Fig. 2.6). This is the basis of the use of yeast in the baking industry for making breads, pastries and cakes. Commercial Use of Microorganisms Microorganisms are used for the large scale production of alcohol, wine and acetic acid (vinegar). Y east is used for commer cial production of alcohol and wine. For this purpose yeast is grown on natural sugars present in grains like barley, wheat, rice, crushed fruit juices , etc. Activity 2.4 Take a 500 mL beaker filled upto \u00be with water . Dissolve 2-3 teaspoons of sugar in it. Add half a Medicinal Use of Microorganisms When ever you fall ill the doctor may give you some antibiotic tablets, capsules or injections such as of penicillin. The source of these medicines is microorganisms. These medicines kill or stop the growth of the disease -causing microorganisms. Such medicines are called antibiotics . These days a number of antibiotics are being produced from bacteria and fungi. Streptomycin, tetracycline and erythromycin are some of the 2024-25 MICROORGANISMS : FRIEND AND FOE 21commonly known antibiotics which are made from fungi and bacteria. The antibiotics are manufactured by growing specific microorganisms and are used to cure a variety of diseases. Antibiotics are even mixed with the feed of livestock and poultry to check microbial infection in animals. They are also used to control many plant diseases. It is important to remember that antibiotics should be taken only on the advi ce of a qualified doctor . Also you must complete the course prescribed by the doctor . If you take antibiotics when not needed or in wrong doses, it may make the drug less effective when you might need it in future. Also antibiotics taken unnecessarily may kill the beneficial bacteria in the body. Antibiotics, however , are not ef fective against cold and flu as these are caused by viruses. Vaccinefrom the disease-causing microbes for ever. This is how a vaccine works. Several diseases, including cholera, tuberculosis, smallpox and hepatitis can be prevented by vaccination. Edward Jenner discovered the vaccine for small- pox in 1798. Why are childreninfants given vaccination? When a disease-carrying microbe enters our body, the body produces antibodies to fight the invader . The body also remembers how to fight the microbe if it enters again. If dead or weakened microbes are introduced in to a healthy body , the body fights and kills the invading bacteria by producing suitable antibodies. The antibodies remain in the body and we are protected In your childhood, you must have been given injections to protect yourself against several diseases. Can you prepare a list of these diseases? Y ou may take help fr om your parents. It is essential to protect all children against these diseases. Necessary vaccines are available in the nearby hospitals. Y ou might have seen the advertisement on TV and newspapers regarding protection of children against polio under the Pulse Polio Programme. Polio drops given to children are actually a vaccine. A worldwide campaign against smallpox has finally led to its eradication from most parts of the world. These days vaccines are made on a large scale from microorganisms to protect humans and other animals from several diseases. Increasing Soil Fertility Some bacteria (Fig. 2.7) are able to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere to enrich soil with nitrogen and increase its fertility. These microbes are commonly called biological nitrogen fixers. 2024-25 SCIENCE 22Cleaning the Environment Boojho and Paheli had observed the school gardener making manure. Along with their friends, they collected wastes of plants, vegetables and fruit s from nearby houses and gardens. They put them in a pit meant for waste disposal. After some time , it decomposed and got converted to manure. Boojho and Paheli wanted to know how this had happen ed. Activity 2.5 Take two pots and fill each pot half with soil. Mark them A and B. Put plant waste in pot A and things like polythene bags, empty glass bottles and broken plastic toys in pot B. Put the pots aside. Observe them after 3-4 weeks. Do you find any difference in the contents of the two pots? If so, what is the dif ference? Y ou will find that plant waste in pot A, has been decomposed. How did this happen? The plant waste has been converted into manure by the action of microbes. The nutrientsreleased in the process can be used by the plants again. Did you notice that in pot B , the polythene bags, empty glasses, bottles and broken toy parts did not undergo any such change? The microbes could not act on them and convert them into manure. You often see lar ge amounts of dead organic matter in the form of decaying plants and sometimes dead animals on the gr ound. Y ou find that they disappear after some time. This is because the microorganisms decompose dead organic waste of plants and animals converting them into simple substances. These substances are again used by other plants and animals. Thus, microorganisms can be used to degrade the harmful and smelly substances and thereby clean up the environment. 2.4Harmful Microorganisms Microorganisms are harmful in many ways. Some of the microorganisms cause diseases in human beings, plants and animals. Such disease-causingFig. 2.7 : The Nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria (blue green algae) 2024-25 MICROORGANISMS : FRIEND AND FOE 23 microorganisms are called pathogens. Some microorganisms spoil food, clothing and leather . Let us study mor e about their harmful activities. Disease causing Microorganisms in Humans Pathogens enter our body through the air we breathe, the water we drink or the food we eat. They can also get transmitted by direct contact with an infected person or carried by an animal. Microbial diseases that can spread from an infected person to a healthy person through air , water , food or physical contact are called communicable diseases . Examples of such diseases include cholera, common cold, chicken pox and tuberculosis. When a person suffering from common cold sneezes, fine droplets of moisture carrying thousands of viruses are spread in the air . The virus may enter the body of a healthy person while breathing and cause infection.There are some insects and animals which act as carriers of disease- causing microbes. Housefly is one such carrier . The flies sit on the garbage and animal excreta. Pathogens stick to their bodies. When these flies sit on uncovered food they may transfer the pathogens. Whoever eats the contaminated food is likely to get sick. So, it is advisable to always keep food covered. Avoid consuming uncovered items of food. Another example of a carrier is the female Anopheles mosquito (Fig. 2.8), which carries the parasite of malaria (Plasmodium). Female Aedes mosquito acts as carrier of dengue virus. How can we control the spread of malaria or dengue? Then how do you prevent the spread of communicable diseases? We should keep a handkerchief on the nose and mouth while sneezing. It is better to keep a distance from infected persons. Fig. 2.8 : Female Anopheles mosquito Why does the teacher keep telling us not to let water collect anywhere in the neighbourhood? All mosquitoes br eed in water . Hence, one should not let water collect anywhere, in coolers, tyres, flower pot, etc. By keeping the surroundings clean and dry we can prevent mosquitoes from breeding. T ry to make a list of measur es which help to avoid the spread of malaria. 2024-25 SCIENCE 24 Some of the common diseases affecting humans, their mode of transmission and few general methods of prevention are shown in Table 2.1. Disease causing Microorganisms in Animals Several microorganisms not only cause diseases in humans and plants, but alsoin other animals. For example, anthrax is a dangerous human and cattle disease caused by a bacterium. Foot and mouth disease of cattle is caused by a virus. Disease causing Microorganisms in Plants Several microorganisms cause diseases in plants like wheat, rice, potato, sugarcane, orange, apple and others. The diseases reduce the yield of crops. See Table 2.2 for some such plant diseases. They can be controlled by theHuman Disease Causative Mode of Preventive Measures Microorganism Transmission (General) Tuberculosis Bacteria Air Measles Virus Air Chicken Pox Virus AirContact Polio Virus AirW ater Cholera Bacteria WaterFood Typhoid Bacteria Water Hepatitis A Virus Water Malaria Protozoa Mosquito Robert K\u00f6ch (1876) discovered the bacterium (Bacillus anthracis) which causes anthrax disease.Keep the patient in complete isolation.

Food Poisoning Boojho was invited by his friend to a party and he ate a variety of foodstuff. On reaching home he started vomiting and had to be taken to a hospital. The doctor said that this condition could be due to food poisoning.make the food poisonous causing serious illness and even death. So, it is very important that we preserve food to prevent it from being spoilt. 2.5 Food Preservation In Chapter 1, we have learnt about the methods used to preserve and store food grains. How do we preserve cooked food at home? Y ou know that br ead left unused under moist conditions is attacked by fungus. Microorganisms spoil our food. Spoiled food emits bad smell and has a bad taste and changed colour . Is spoiling of food a chemical reaction? Paheli bought some mangoes but she could not eat them for a few days. Later she found that they were spoilt and rotten. But she knows that the mango pickle her grandmother makes does not spoil for a long time. She is confused.Plant Micro- Mode of Diseases organism Transmission Citrus Bacteria Air canker Rust of Fungi Air, wheat seeds Yellow vein Virus Insect mosaic of bhindi (Okra) Paheli wonders how food can become a poison. Table 2.2: Some Common Plant Diseases caused by Microorganisms Food poisoning could be due to the consumption of food spoilt by some microorganisms. Microorganisms that grow on our food sometimes produce toxic substances. These 2024-25 SCIENCE 26Let us study the common methods of pr eserving food in our homes. W e have to save it from the attack of microorganisms. Chemical Method Salts and edible oils are the common chemicals generally used to check the growth of microorganisms. Therefore they ar e called preservatives . We add salt or acid preservatives to pickles to prevent the attack of microbes. Sodium benzoate and sodium metabisulphite are common preservatives. These are also used in jams and squashes to check their spoilage . Preservation by Common Salt Common salt has been used to preserve meat and fish for ages. Meat and fish are covered with dry salt to check the growth of bacteria. Salting is also used to preserve amla , raw mangoes, tamarind, etc. Preservation by Sugar Jams, jellies and squashes are preserved by sugar . Sugar r educes the moistur e content which inhibits the growth of bacteria which spoil food. Preservation by Oil and Vinegar Use of oil and vinegar prevents spoilage of pickles because bacteria cannot live in such an envir onment. V egetables, fruits, fish and meat are often preserved by this method. Heat and Cold Treatments You must have observed your mother boiling milk before it is stored or used. Boiling kills many microorganisms.Similarly, we keep our food in the refrigerator . Low temperatur e inhibits the growth of microbes. Pasteurised milk can be consumed without boiling as it is free from harmful microbes. The milk is heated to about 700C for 15 to 30 seconds and then suddenly chilled and stored. By doing so, it prevents the growth of microbes. This process was discovered by Louis Pasteur . It is called pasteurisation . Storage and Packing These days dry fruits and even vegetables are sold in sealed air tight packets to prevent the attack of microbes. 2.6Nitrogen Fixation You have lear nt about the bacterium Rhizobium in Classes VI and VII. It is involved in the fixation of nitrogen in leguminous plants (pulses). Recall that Rhizobium lives in the root nodules of leguminous plants (Fig. 2.9), such as beans and peas, with which it has a symbiotic relationship. Sometimes nitrogen gets fixed through the action of lightning. But you know that the amount of nitrogen in the atmosphere remains constant. Y ou may wonder how? Let us understand this in the next section. Why does the milk that comes in packets not spoil? My mother told me that the milk is pasteurised. What is pasteurisation? 2024-25 MICROORGANISMS : FRIEND AND FOE 27nitrogen cannot be taken directly by plants and animals. Certain bacteria and blue green algae present in the soil fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert it into compounds of nitrogen. Once nitrogen is converted into these usable compounds, it can be utilised by plants from the soil through their root system. Nitrogen is then used for the synthesis of plant proteins and other compounds. Animals feeding on plants get these proteins and other nitrogen compounds (Fig. 2.10). When plants and animals die, bacteria and fungi present in the soil convert the nitrogenous wastes into nitrogenous compounds to be used by plants again. Certain other bacteria convert some part of them to nitrogen gas which goes back into the atmosphere. As a result, the percentage of nitrogen in the atmosphere remains more or less constant. Fig. 2.10 : Nitrogen cycle Fig. 2.9 : Roots of a leguminous plant with root nodules 2.7 Nitrogen cycle Our atmosphere has 78 nitrogen gas.

Y ou have alr eady studied about water in Class VII. Is water a limitless resource? In the light of the availability of various resources in nature, natural resources can be broadly classified into two kinds: (i) Inexhaustible Natural Resources: These resources are present in unlimited quantity in nature and are not likely to be exhausted by human activities. Examples ar e: sunlight, air . (ii) Exhaustible Natural Resources: The amount of these resources in nature is limited. They can be exhausted by human activities. Examples of these resources are forests, wildlife, minerals, coal, petroleum, natural gas etc. Activity 3.2 (It is a group activity) Take some containers. Fill them with popcornpeanutsroasted gramtoffees. Divide students into groups of seven each. Further divide each group into three subgroups containing 1, 2 and 4 students. Label them as first, second and third generation respectively.We use various materials for our basic needs. Some of them are found in nature and some have been made by human efforts. Activity 3.1 Make a list of various materials used by us in daily life and classify them as natural and man-made. Natural Man-made Can we use all our natural resources forever ? Does this list include air , water , soil and minerals? Since all these are obtained from nature, they are called natural resources. 2024-25 These sub-groups represent the consumers. As population is growing, second and third generations have larger number of consumers. Put one full container for each group on a table. Ask consumers of the first generation from each group to consume eatables from the container of their group. Now, ask the second generation consumers from each group to do the same. Ask students to observe carefully the availability of eatables in each container . If some thing is left in the containers, ask third generation from each group to consume it. Now, finally observe whether all the consumers of the third generation got the eatables or not. Also observe if anything is still left in any of the containers. Assume that the eatables in the container represent the total availability of an exhausible natural resource like coal, petroleum or natural gas. Each group may have a different consumption pattern. Are the earlier generations of any group too greedy? It may be that the earlier generations in some groups were concerned about the coming generation(s) and left something for them. In this chapter we will learn about some exhaustible natural resources like coal, petroleum and natural gas. These were formed from the dead remains of living organisms (fossils). So, these are all known as fossil fuels.3.1 Coal You may have seen coal or hear d about it (Fig. 3.1). It is as hard as stone and is black in colour . Fig. 3.1: Coal Coal is one of the fuels used to cook food. Earlier , it was used in railway engines to produce steam to run the engine. It is also used in thermal power plants to produce electricity. Coal is also used as a fuel in various industries. Story of Coal Where do we get coal from and how is it formed? About 300 million years ago the earth had dense forests in low lying wetland areas. Due to natural processes, like flooding, these forests got buried under the soil. As more soil deposited over them, they were compressed. The temperature also rose as they sank deeper and deeper . Under high pr essur e and high temperature, dead plants got slowly converted to coal. As coal contains mainly carbon, the slow process of conversion of dead vegetation into coal is called carbonisation. Since it was formed from the remains of vegetation, coal is also called a fossil fuel. A coal mine is shown in Fig. 3.2. COAL AND PETROLEUM 33 2024-25 SCIENCE 34 Fig. 3.2: A coal mine Coal Gas Coal gas is obtained during the processing of coal to get coke. It is used Coal gas was used for street lighting for the first time in London in 1810 and in New Y ork ar ound 1820. Now a days, it is used as a source of heat rather than light.These days, bitumen, a petroleum product, is used in place of coal-tar for metalling the roads. Fig. 3.3: Coal tarWhen heated in air , coal bur ns and produces mainly carbon dioxide gas. Coal is processed in industry to get some useful products such as coke, coal tar and coal gas. Coke It is a tough, porous and black substance. It is an almost pure form of carbon. Coke is used in the manufacture of steel and in the extraction of many metals. Coal Tar It is a black, thick liquid (Fig. 3.3) with an unpleasant smell. It is a mixture ofabout 200 substances. Products obtained from coal tar are used as starting materials for manufacturing various substances used in everyday life and in industry, like synthetic dyes, drugs, explosives, per fumes, plastics, paints, photographic materials, roofing materials, etc. Interestingly, naphthalene balls used to repel moths and other insects are also obtained from coal tar . 2024-25 COAL AND PETROLEUM 35as a fuel in many industries situated near the coal processing plants. 3.2 Petroleum You know that petr ol is used as a fuel in light automobiles such as motor cycles scooters and cars. Heavy motor vehicles like trucks and tractors run on diesel. Petrol and diesel are obtained from a natural resource called petroleum. The word petroleum is derived from petra (rock) and oleum (oil) as it is mined from between the rocks under Earth as shown in Fig. 3.4. Do you know how petroleum is formed? Petroleum was formed from organisms living in the sea. As these organisms died, their bodies settled at the bottom of the sea and got covered with layers of sand and clay. Over millions of years, absence of air , high temperature and high pressureRefining of Petroleum Petroleum is a dark oily liquid. It has an unpleasant odour . It is a mixtur e of various constituents such as petroleum gas, petrol, diesel, lubricating oil, paraffin wax, etc. The process of Fig. 3.4 : Petroleum and natural gas depositsThe worlds first oil well was drilled in Pennsylvania, USA, in 1859. Eight years later , in 1867, oil was struck at Makum in Assam. In India, oil is found in Assam, Gujarat, Mumbai High and in the river basins of Godavari and Krishna.transformed the dead organisms into petroleum and natural gas. Look at Fig. 3.4. It shows the deposits of petr oleum and natural gas. Y ou see that the layer containing petroleum oil and gas is above that of water . Why is it so? Recall that oil and gas are lighter than water and do not mix with it. Wells Gas Oil WaterReservoir rockImpervious rock 2024-25 SCIENCE 36separating the various constituents fractions of petroleum is known as refining. It is carried out in a petroleum refinery (Fig. 3.5).Various constituents of petr oleum and their uses are given in Table 3.1. Many useful substances are obtained from petroleum and natural gas. These are termed as Petrochemicals. These are used in the manufacture of deter gents, fibr es (polyester , nylon, acrylic etc.), polythene and other man-made plastics. Hydrogen gas obtained from natural gas, is used in the production of fertilisers (urea). Due to its great commercial importance, petroleum is also called black gold. 3.3 Natural Gas Natural gas is a very important fossil fuel because it is easy to transport through pipes. Natural gas is stored under high pressure as compressed natural gas (CNG). CNG is used for power generation. It is now being used Table 3.1 V arious Constituents of Petr oleum and their Uses S.No. Constituents of Petroleum Uses 1. Petroleum Gas in Liquid form Fuel for home and industry (LPG) 2.

Bitumen Paints, road surfacingFig. 3.5: A petroleum refinery 2024-25 COAL AND PETROLEUM 37as a fuel for transport vehicles because it is less polluting. It is a cleaner fuel. The great advantage of CNG is that it can be used directly for burning in homes and factories where it can be supplied through pipes. Such a network of pipelines exists in V adodara (Gujarat), some parts of Delhi and other places. Natural gas is also used as a starting material for the manufacture of a number of chemicals and fertilisers. India has vast reserves of natural gas. In our country, natural gas has been found in T ripura, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and in the Krishna Godavari delta.3.4Some Natural Resources are Limited You have studied in the beginning of the chapter that some natural resources are exhaustible like fossil fuels, forests, minerals etc. You know that coal and petr oleum are fossil fuels. It required the dead organisms millions of years to get converted into these fuels. On the other hand, the known reserves of these will last only a few hundred years. Mor eover , bur ning of these fuels is a major cause of air pollution. Their use is also linked to global warming. It is therefore necessary that we use these fuels only when absolutely necessary. This will result in better environment, smaller risk of global warming and their availability for a longer period of time. In India, the Petroleum Conservation Research Association (PCRA) advises people how to save petroldiesel while driving. Their tips are ldrive at a constant and moderate speed as far as possible, lswitch off the engine at traffic lights or at a place where you have to wait, lensure correct tyre pressure. lensure regular maintenance of the vehicle.Can coal, petroleum and natural gas be prepared in the laboratory from dead organisms? No. Their formation is a very slow process and conditions for their formation cannot be created in the laboratory. 2024-25 SCIENCE 38 KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS COAL COAL GAS COAL T AR COKE FOSSIL FUEL NATURAL GAS PETROLEUM PETROLEUM REFINERY WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT \u00dcCoal, petroleum and natural gas are fossil fuels. \u00dcFossil fuels were formed from the dead remains of living organisms millions of years ago. \u00dcFossil fuels are exhaustible resources. \u00dcCoke, coal tar and coal gas are the products of coal. \u00dcPetroleum gas, petrol, diesel, kerosene, paraffin wax, lubricating oil are obtained by refining petroleum. \u00dcCoal and petr oleum r esour ces ar e limited.

{"chapter": "4", "title": "Chapter 4: 4. Combustion and Flame", "content": "COMBUSTION AND FLAME COMBUSTION AND FLAME We use dif ferent kinds of fuel for various purposes at home, in industry and for running automobiles. Can you name a few fuels used in our homes? Name a few fuels used in trade and industry. What fuels ar e used for running automobiles? Y our list will contain fuels like cowdung, wood, coal, charcoal, petrol, diesel, compressed natural gas (CNG), etc. You ar e familiar with the bur ning of a candle. What is the difference between the burning of a candle and the burning of a fuel like coal? May be you were able to guess right: candle burns with a flame whereas coal does not. Similarly, you will find many other materials burning without a flame. Let us study the chemical process of burning and the types of flame produced during this process. 4.1 What is Combustion? Recall the activity of burning of magnesium ribbon per formed in Class VII. W e lear nt that magnesium burns to form magnesium oxide and produces heat and light (Fig. 4.1). We can per form a similar activity with a piece of charcoal. Hold the piece with a pair of tongs and bring it near the flame of a candle or a Bunsen bur ner. What do you observe? We find that char coal bur ns in air . We know that coal, too, bur ns in air producing carbon dioxide, heat and light.We wer e told that food is a fuel for our body. Fig. 4.1 : Burning of magnesium A chemical process in which a substance reacts with oxygen to give off heat is called combustion . The substance that undergoes combustion is said to be combustible. It is also called a fuel. The fuel may be solid, liquid or gas. Sometimes, light is also given off during combustion, either as a flame or as a glow. In the reactions mentioned above magnesium and charcoal are combustible substances. 2024-25 Activity 4.2 (Caution : Be careful while handling burning candle). Fix a lighted candle on a table. Put a glass chimney over the candle and rest it on a few wooden blocks in such a way that air can enter the Table 4.1: Combustible and Non- combustible Substances Material Combustible Non- combustible Wood Paper Iron nails Kerosene oil Stone piece Straw Charcoal Matchsticks GlassActivity 4.1 Collect some materials like straw, matchsticks, ker osene oil, paper , iron nails, stone pieces, glass etc. Under the supervision of your teacher try to burn each of these materials one by one. If combustion takes place mark the material combustible , otherwise mark it non-combustible (Table 4.1).(a) (b) (c) Fig. 4.2: Experiment to show that air is essential for burning Rightly so. In our body food is broken down by reaction with oxygen and heat is pr oduced. W e learnt that in Class VII. Can you name some more substances which ar e combustible? Y ou can add those to Table 4.1. Let us investigate conditions under which combustion takes place. COMBUSTION AND FLAME 41chimney [Fig. 4.2(a)]. Observe what happens to the flame. Now remove the blocks and let the chimney rest on the table [Fig. 4.2(b)]. Again observe the flame. Finally, put a glass plate over the chimney [Fig. 4.2(c)]. W atch the flame again. What happens in the three cases? Does the flame flicker off? Does it flicker and give smoke? Does it burn unaffected? Can you infer anything at all about the role played by air in the process of burning? We find that for combustion, air is necessary. The candle burns freely in case (a) when air can enter the chimney from below. In case (b), when air does not enter the chimney from below, the flame flickers and produces smoke. In case (c), the flame finally goes off because the air is not available. 2024-25 SCIENCE 42Activity 4.3 Place a piece of burning wood or charcoal on an iron plate or Tawa . Cover it with a glass jar or a tumbler , or a transpar ent plastic jar . Observe what happens. Does charcoal stop burning after sometime? Can you think of the reason why it stops burning? You might have hear d that when the clothes of a person catch fire, the personWe have r ead that the sun produces its own heat and light. Is it also some kind of combustion? In the sun, heat and light are produced by nuclear r eactions. Y ou will learn about this process in higher classes. During extreme heat of summer , at some places dry grass catches fire. From the grass, it spreads to trees, and very soon the whole forest is on fire (Fig. 4.4). It is very difficult to control such fires. Fig. 4.4 : Forest fireFig. 4.3 : Blanket wrapped around a person whose clothes caught fire Now recall some of your experiences. Does a matchstick burn by itself? How does it burn? You must have had an experience of burning a piece of paper . Does it bur n when a burning matchstick is brought near it? Can you burn a piece of wood by bringing a lighted matchstick near it? Why do you have to use paper or kerosene oil to start fire in wood or coal? Have you heard of forest fires?is covered with a blanket to extinguish fire (Fig. 4.3). Can you guess why? 2024-25 COMBUSTION AND FLAME 43We find that a combustible substance cannot catch fire or burn as long as its temperature is lower than its ignition temperature. Have you ever seen cooking oil catching fire when a frying pan is kept for long on a burning stove? Kerosene oil and wood do not catch fire on their own at room temperature. But, if kerosene oil is heated a little, it will catch fire. But if wood is heated a little, it would still not catch fire. Does it mean that ignition temperature of kerosene oil is lower than that of wood? Does it mean that we need to take special care in storing kerosene oil? The following activity shows that it is essential for a substance to reach ignition temperature to burn. Activity 4.4 (Caution : Be careful while handling burning candle). Make two paper cups by folding a sheet of paper . Pour about 50 mL of water in one of the cups. Heat both the cups separately with a candle (Fig. 4.5). What do you observe?The history of the matchstick is very old. More than five thousand years ago small pieces of pinewood dipped in sulphur were used as matches in ancient Egypt. The modern safety match was developed only about two hundred years ago. A mixture of antimony trisulphide, potassium chlorate and white phosphorus with some glue and starch was applied on the head of a match made of suitable wood. When struck against a rough surface, white phosphorus got ignited due to the heat of friction. This started the combustion of the match. However , white phosphorus proved to be dangerous both for the workers involved in the manufacturing of matches and for the users. These days the head of the safety match contains only antimony trisulphide and potassium chlorate. The rubbing surface has powdered glass and a little red phosphorus (which is much less dangerous). When the match is struck against the rubbing surface, some red phosphorus gets converted into white phosphorus. This immediately reacts with potassium chlorate in the matchstick head to produce enough heat to ignite antimony trisulphide and start the combustion.Do these experiences tell you that different substances catch fire at different temperatures? The lowest temperature at which a substance catches fire is called its ignition temperature. Can you tell now why a matchstick does not catch fire on its own at room temperature? Why does the matchstick start burning on rubbing it on the side of the matchbox? Fig. 4.5 : Heating water in a paper cup water paper cups What happens to the empty paper cup? What happens to the paper cup with water? Does water in this cup become hot? 2024-25 SCIENCE 44If we continue heating the cup, we can even boil water in the paper cup. Can you think of an explanation for this phenomenon? The heat supplied to the paper cup is transferred to water by conduction. So, in the presence of water , the ignition temperature of paper is not reached. Hence, it does not burn. The substances which have very low ignition temperature and can easily catch fire with a flame are called inflammable substances . Examples of inflammable substances are petrol, alcohol, Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) etc. Can you list some more inflammable substances? 4.2How Do W e Contr ol Fir e? You must have seen or hear d of fir e breaking out in homes, shops and factories. If you have seen such an accident, write a short description in your note book. Also, share the experience with your classmates. It is important that all of us know the telephone numbers of the fire service.Fig. 4.6: Firemen extinguish the fire by throwing water under pressure Find out the telephone number of the fire service in your area. If a fire breaks out in your house or in your neighbourhood, the first thing to do is to call the fire service.Does your citytown have a fire brigade station? When a fire brigade arrives, what does it do? It pours water on the fire (Fig. 4 .6). W ater cools the combustible material so that its temperature is brought below its ignition temperature. This prevents the fire from spr eading. W ater vapour s also surround the combustible material, helping in cutting of f the supply of air . So, the fire is extinguished. You have lear nt that ther e are three essential requirements for producing fire. Can you list these requirements? These are: fuel, air (to supply oxygen) and heat (to raise the temperature of the fuel beyond the ignition temperature). Fire can be controlled by removing one or more of these requirements. The job of a fire extinguisher is to cut off the supply of air, or to bring down the temperatur e of the fuel, or both. Notice that the fuel 2024-25 COMBUSTION AND FLAME 45The most common fire extinguisher is water . But water works only when things like wood and paper are on fire. If electrical equipment is on fire, water may conduct electricity and harm those trying to douse the fir e. W ater is also not suitable for fires involving oil and petrol. Do you recall that water is heavier than oil? So, it sinks below the oil, and oil keeps burning on the top. For fires involving electrical equipment and inflammable materials like petrol, carbon dioxide (CO2) is the best extinguisher . CO2, being heavier than oxygen, covers the fire like a blanket. Since the contact between the fuel and oxygen is cut off, the fire is controlled. The added advantage of CO2 is that in most cases it does not harm the electrical equipment. How do we get the supply of carbon dioxide? It can be stored at high pressure as a liquid in cylinders. In what form is the LPG stored in cylinders? When released fr om the cylinder , CO2 expands enor mously in volume and cools down. So, it not only forms a blanket around the fire, it also brings down the temperatur e of the fuel. That is why it is an excellent fir e extinguisher . Another way to get CO2 is to release a lot of dry powder of chemicals like sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) or potassium bicarbonate. Near the fire, these chemicals give off CO2. CAUTION : Do not handle the gas stove yourself. Ask your parents to help. Fig. 4.7 : Fire extinguisher in most cases cannot be eliminated. If, for instance, a building catches fire, the whole building is the fuel. 4.3Types of Combustion Bring a burning matchstick or a gas lighter near a gas stove in the kitchen. Turn on the knob of the gas stove. What do you observe?We find that the gas bur ns rapidly and produces heat and light. Such combustion is known as rapid combustion . There are substances like phosphorus which burn in air at room temperature. The type of combustion in which a material suddenly bursts into flames, without the application of any apparent cause is called spontaneous combustion. 2024-25 SCIENCE 46 Spontaneous combustion of coal dust has resulted in many disastrous fires in coal mines. Spontaneous forest fires are sometimes due to the heat of the sun or due to lightning strike. However , most for est fir es ar e due to the carelessness of human beings. It is important to remember that the campfires must be completely extinguished before leaving a forest after a picnic, or a visit. We generally have fir eworks on festival days. When a cracker is ignited, a sudden reaction takes place with the evolution of heat, light and sound. A large amount of gas formed in the reaction is liberated. Such a reaction is called explosion. Explosion can also take place if pressure is applied on the cracker . 4.4Flame Observe an LPG flame. Can you tell the colour of the flame. What is the colour of a candle flame? Recall your experience of burning a magnesium ribbon in Class VII. If you do not have experience of burning the remaining items in Table 4.2 you can do that now.

Hold a 4 -5 cm long thin glass tube with a pair of tongs and introduce its one end in the dark zone of a non-flickering candle flame (Fig. 4.10). Bring a lighted matchstick near the other end of the glass tube. Do you see a flame caught at this end of the glass tube after a while? If so, what is it that produces a flame? Notice that the wax near the heated wick melts quickly. The substances which vapourise during burning, give flames. For example, kerosene oil and molten wax rise through the wick and are vapourised during burning and form flames. Charcoal, on the other hand, does not vapourise and so does not produce a flame. In Activity 4.5, could the vapours of wax coming out of the glass tube be the cause of the flame produced? Fig. 4.10 Fig. 4.12When the candle flame is steady, introduce a clean glass plateslide into the luminous zone of the flame (Fig. 4.11). Hold it there with a pair of tongs for about 10 seconds. Then remove it. What do you observe?Fig. 4.11 A circular blackish ring is formed on the glass plateslide. It indicates the deposition of unburnt carbon particles present in the luminous zone of the flame. Hold a thin long copper wire just inside the non-luminous zone of flame for about 30 seconds (Fig. 4.12). Notice that the portion of the copper wire just outside the flame gets red hot. Does it indicate that the non-luminous zone of the flame has a high 2024-25 SCIENCE 48 Fig. 4.14 : Goldsmith blowing through a metallic pipe4.6What is a Fuel? Recall that the sources of heat energy for domestic and industrial purposes are mainly wood, charcoal, petrol, kerosene etc. These substances are called fuels. A good fuel is one which is readily available. It is cheap. It burns easily in air at a moderate rate. It produces a large amount of heat. It does not leave behind any undersirable substances. There is probably no fuel that could be consider ed as an ideal fuel . We should look for a fuel which fulfils most of the requirements for a particular use. Fuels differ in their cost. Some fuels are cheaper than others. Make a list of fuels familiar to you. Group them as solid, liquid and gaseous fuels as in Table 4.3. 4.7Fuel Efficiency Suppose you were asked to boil a given quantity of water using cow dung, coal and LPG as fuel. Which fuel would you prefer? Give your r eason. Y ou may take the help of your parents. Do these three fuels produce the same amount of heat? The amount of heat energy produced on complete combustion of 1 kg of a fuel is called its calorific value. The calorific value of a fuel is expressed in a unitFig. 4.13 : Different zones of candle flame Table 4.3 : Types of Fuels S. No. Solid Fuels Liquid Fuels Gaseous Fuels 1. Coal Kerosene oil Natural gas 2. 3. hottest part moderately hot least hot wax candleouter zone of complete combustion (blue) middle zone of partial combustion (yellow) innermost zone of unburnt wax vapours (black)temperature? In fact, this part of the flame is the hottest part (Fig. 4.13). Goldsmiths blow the outermost zone of a flame with a metallic blow-pipe for melting gold and silver (Fig. 4.14). Why do they use the outermost zone of the flame? 2024-25 COMBUSTION AND FLAME 49 particles. These fine particles are dangerous pollutants causing respiratory diseases, such as asthma. 2.Incomplete combustion of these fuels gives carbon monoxide gas. It is a very poisonous gas. It is dangerous to burn coal in a closed room. The carbon monoxide gas produced can kill persons sleeping in that room. For centuries, wood was used as domestic and industrial fuel. But now it has been replaced by coal and other fuels like LPG. In many rural parts of our country, people still use wood as a fuel because of its easy availability and low cost. However , burning of wood gives a lot of smoke which is very harmful for human beings. It causes respiratory problem. Also, trees provide us with useful substances which are lost when wood is used as fuel. Moreover cutting of trees leads to deforestation which is quite harmful to the environment, as you learnt in Class VII.Table 4.4 : Calorific V alues of dif ferent Fuels Fuel Calorific V alue (kJkg) Cow dung cake 6000-8000 Wood 17000-22000 Coal 25000-33000 Petrol 45000 Kerosene 45000 Diesel 45000 Methane 50000 CNG 50000 LPG 55000 Biogas 35000-40000 Hydrogen 150000 Oh! So, that is why we are advised never to sleep in a room with burning or smouldering coal fire in it. Burning of Fuels Leads to Harmful Products The increasing fuel consumption has harmful effects on the environment. 1.Carbon fuels like wood, coal, petroleum release unburnt carbon3.Combustion of most fuels releases carbon dioxide in the environment. Increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the air is believed to cause global warming . Global warming is the rise in temperature of the atmosphere of the earth. This results , among other things, in the melting of polar glaciers , which leads to a rise in the sea level, causing floods in the coastal areas . Low lying coastal areas may even be permanently submer ged under water . 4.Burning of coal and diesel releases sulphur dioxide gas. It is an extremely suffocating and corr osive gas. Mor eover , petrol engines give off gaseous oxides of nitrogen. Oxides of sulphur and nitrogen dissolve in rain water and form acids. Such rain is called acid rain . It is very harmful for crops, buildings and soil. The use of diesel and petrol as fuels in automobiles is being replaced by CNG (Compressed Natural Gas), because CNG produces the harmful products in very small amounts. CNG is a cleaner fuel.called kilojoule per kg (kJkg).

Conservation of Plants and Animals", "content": "CONSERVATION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS CONSERVATION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS We saw in Class VII that Paheli and Boojho had visited the forest along with Professor Ahmad and T ibu. They wer e eager to share their experiences with their classmates. Other children in the class were also eager to share their experiences as some of them had visited Bharatpur Sanctuary. Some others had heard about Kaziranga National Park, Lockchao Wildlife Sanctuary, Great Nicobar Biospher e Reserve and T iger Reserve, etc.Some natural causes of deforestation are forest fires and severe droughts. Activity 5.1 Add more causes of deforestation to your list and classify them into natural and man-made. 5.2Consequences of Deforestation Paheli and Boojho recalled the consequences of deforestation. They remembered that deforestation increases the temperature and pollution level on the earth. It increases the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Ground water level also gets lowered. They know that deforestation disturbs the balance in nature. They were told by Professor Ahmad that if cutting of trees continues, rainfall and the fertility of the soil will 5.1 Deforestation and Its Causes A great variety of plants and animals exist on earth. They are essential for the well-being and survival of mankind. Today, a major threat to survival of these organisms is deforestation . We know that deforestation means clearing of forests and using that land for other purposes. T r ees in the for est ar e cut for some of the purposes mentioned below: lProcuring land for cultivation. lBuilding houses and factories. lMaking furniture or using wood as fuel.How does deforestation reduce rainfall on the one hand and lead to floods on the other? decr ease. Mor eover , ther e will be increased chances of natural calamities such as floods and droughts. Recall that plants need carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. Fewer trees would mean that less carbon dioxide will be used up resulting in its increasedWhat is the purpose of making national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and biosphere reserves? 2024-25 SCIENCE 54amount in the atmosphere. This will lead to global warming as carbon dioxide traps the heat rays reflected by the earth. The increase in temperature on the earth disturbs the water cycle and may reduce rainfall. This could cause droughts . Deforestation is a major cause which leads to the change in soil properties. Physical properties of the soil get affected by plantation and vegetation. Fewer trees result in more soil erosion. Removal of the top layer of the soil exposes the lower , har d and r ocky layers. This soil has less humus and is less fertile. Gradually the fertile land gets converted into deserts. It is called desertification . Deforestation also leads to a decrease in the water holding capacity of the soil. The movement of water from the soil surface into the gr ound (infiltration rate) is reduced. So, there are floods. The other properties of the soil like nutrient content, texture etc., also change because of deforestation. We have studied in Class VII that we get many products from forests. List these products. Will we face shortage of these products if we continue cutting trees? Activity 5.2 Animal life is also affected by deforestation. How? List the points and discuss them in your class. 5.3 Conservation of Forest and Wildlife Having become aware of the effects of deforestation, Paheli and Boojho are worried. They go to Professor Ahmad and ask him how forests and wildlife can be saved.Biosphere is that part of the earth in which living organisms exist or which supports life. Biological diversity or biodiversity, refers to the variety of organisms existing on the earth, their interrelationships and their relationship with the environment. Professor Ahmad organi ses a visit to a biosphere reserve for Paheli, Boojho and their classmates. He selects a place named Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve. He knows that the plants and animals found here are similar to those of the upper Himalayan peaks and to those belonging to the lower western ghats. Professor Ahmad believes that the biodiversity found here is unique. He requests Madhavji, a forest employee, to guide the children inside the biosphere reserve. He explains that preserving areas of such biological importance make them a part of our national heritage . Madhavji explains to the children that apart from our personal efforts and efforts of the society, government To protect our flora and fauna and their habitats, protected areas called wildlife sanctuaries, national parks and biosphere reserves have been earmarked. Plantation, cultivation, grazing, felling trees, hunting and poaching are prohibited there. Wildlife Sanctuary : Areas where animals are protected from any disturbance to them and their habitat . National Park : Areas reserved for wild life where they can freely use the habitats and natural resources. Biosphere Reserve : Large areas of protected land for conservation of wild life, plant and animal resources and traditional life of the tribals living in the area. 2024-25 CONSER VATION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS 55agencies also take care of the forests and animals. The government lays down rules, methods and policies to protect and conserve them. Wildlife sanctuaries, national parks, biosphere reserves etc., are protected areas for conservation of plants and animals present in that area. Activity 5.3 Find out the number of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and biosphere reserves in your district, state and country. Record in Table 5.1. Show these areas in an outline map of your state and India. Fig. 5.1 : Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve5.4Biosphere Reserve Children along with Professor Ahmad and Madhavji enter the biosphere reserve area. Madhavji explains that biosphere reserves are the areas meant for conservation of biodiversity. As you are aware that biodiversity is the variety of plants, animals and microorganisms generally found in an area. The biosphere reserves help to maintain the biodiversity and culture of that area. A biosphere reserve may also contain other protected areas in it. The Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve consists of one national park named Satpura and two wildlife sanctuaries named Bori and Pachmarhi (Fig. 5.1).

Some of these factors and human activities may disturb the biodiversity unknowingly. List these human activities. How can these be checked? Discuss in your class and write a brief report in your notebook. 5.5 Flora and Fauna As the children walk around the biosphere reserve they appreciate thegreen wealth of the forest. They are very happy to see tall teak trees and animals inside the forest. Suddenly, Paheli finds a rabbit and wants to catch it. She starts running after it. Professor Ahmad stops her . He explains that animals are comfortable and happy in their own habitat. W e should not disturb them. Madhavji explains that some animals and plants typically belong to a particular area. The plants and animals found in a particular area are termed flora and fauna respectively of that area. Sal, teak, mango, jamun , silver ferns, arjun, etc., are the flora and chinkara , blue- bull, barking deer , cheetal , leopar d, wild dog, wolf, etc. ar e examples of the fauna of the Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve (Fig. 5.2).

Is it true?Activity 5.5 Try to identify the flora and fauna of your area and list them. 5.6Endemic Species Soon the group quietly enters the deep forest. Children are surprised to see a very big squirrel. This squirrel has a big fluffy tail. They are very curious to know about it. Madhavji tells them that this is known as the giant squirrel and is endemic to this area. Endemic species are those species of plants and animals which are found exclusively in a particular area. They are not naturally found anywhere else. A particular type of animal or plant may be endemic to a zone, a state or a country. Madhavji shows sal and wild mango (Fig. 5.3 (a)] as two examples of the Fig. 5.3 (a) : Wild Mango Fig. 5.3 (b) : Giant squirrelendemic flora of the Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve. Bison, Indian giant squirrel [Fig. 5.3 (b)] and flying squirrel are endemic fauna of this area. Professor Ahmad explains that the destruction of their habitat, increasing population and introduction of new species may affect the natural habitat of endemic species and endanger their existence. Species is a group of population which are capable of interbreeding. This means that the members of a species can reproduce fertile offspring only with the members of their own species and not with members of other species. Members of a species have common characteristics. Activity 5.6 Find out the endemic plants and animals of the region where you live. 2024-25 SCIENCE 585.7 Wildlife Sanctuary Soon Paheli sees a board with Pachmarhi Wildlife Sanctuary written on it. Professor Ahmad explains that killing (poaching) or capturing animals in general is strictly prohibited and punishable by law in all such places. Wildlife Sanctuaries like reserve forests provide protection and suitable living conditions to wild animals. He also tells them that people living in wildlife sanctuaries are allowed to do certain activities such as grazing by their livestock, collecting medicinal plants, firewood, etc.instead of their natural habitat? In your opinion, will the animals be comfortable in a zoo or in their natural habitat? 5.8 National Park On the roadside there was another board on which was written Satpura National Park. Children are now eager to go there. Madhavji tells them that these reserves are large and diverse enough to protect whole sets of ecosystems. They preserve flora, fauna, landscape and historic objects of an area. Satpura National Park is the first Reserve Forest of India. The finest Indian teak is found in this forest. There are more than one hundred National Parks i n India. It is a pity that even protected forests are not safe because people living in the neighbourhood encroach upon them and destroy them. Children are reminded of their visit to the zoo. They recall that zoos are also places where animals receive protection.Some of the threatened wild animals like black buck, white eyed buck, elephant, golden cat, pink headed duck, gharial, marsh crocodile, python, rhinoceros, etc., are protected and preserved in our wild life sanctuaries. Indian sanctuaries have unique landscapesbroad level forests, mountain forests and bush lands in deltas of big rivers. Activity 5.7 Visit a nearby zoo. Observe the conditions provided to the animals. Were they suitable for the animals? Can animals live in artificial settingRock shelters are also found inside the Satpura National Park. These are evidences of prehistoric human life in these jungles. These give us an idea of the life of primitive people. Rock paintings are found in these shelters. A total of 55 rock shelters have been identified in Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve. Figures of animals and men fighting, hunting, dancing and playing musical instruments are depicted in these paintings. Many tribals still live in the area. As children move ahead, they see a boar d with Satpura T iger Reserve written on it. Madhavji explains that Project Tiger was launched by the government to protect the tigers in the country. The objective of this project was to ensure the survival and maintenance of the tiger population in the country.What is the difference between a zoo and a wildlife sanctuary? 2024-25 CONSER VATION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS 59Are tigers still found in this forest? I hope I can see a tiger! Tiger (Fig. 5.4) is one of the many species which are slowly disappearing from our for ests. But, the Satpura T iger Reserve is unique in the sense that a significant increase in the population of tigers has been seen here. Once upon a time, animals like lions, elephants, wild animals has become difficult because of disturbances in their natural habitat. Professor Ahmad tells them that in order to protect plants and animals strict rules are imposed in all National Parks. Human activities such as grazing, poaching, hunting, capturing of animals Fig. 5.4 : Tiger buffaloes (Fig. 5 .5) and barasingha (Fig. 5.6) were also found in the Satpura National Park. Animals whose numbers are diminishing to a level that they might face extinction are known as the endangered animals . Boojho is reminded of the dinosaurs which became extinct a long time ago. Survival of some Fig. 5.5 : Wild buffaloFig. 5.6 : Barasingha Are only big animals facing extinction? Madhavji tells Paheli that small animals are much more in danger of becoming extinct than the bigger animals. At times, we kill snakes, frogs, lizards, bats and owls ruthlessly without realising their importance in the ecosystem. By killing them we are harming ourselves. They might be small in size but their role in the ecosystem cannot be ignored. They form part of food chains and food webs. An ecosystem is made of all the plants, animals and microorganisms in an area along with non-living components such as climate, soil, river deltas etc.or collection of firewood, mdicinal plants, etc. are not allowed 2024-25 SCIENCE 605.9Red Data Book Professor Ahmad explains about Red Data Book to the children. He tells them that Red Data Book is the source book which keeps a record of all the endangered animals and plants. Red Data Book is maintained internationally by an organisation . India also maintains Red Data Book for plants and animal s found in India. 5.10 Migration The excursion party then enters deeper into the forest under the guidance of Madhavji. They sit near the Tawa What would happen if we had no wood? Is there any alternative available to wood? I know that paper is one of the important products we get from forests. I wonder whether there are any alternatives available for paper!Is there any permanent solution to the problem of deforestation?Reservoir to relax for some time. Paheli observes some of the birds near the river. Madhavji tells the childr en that these are migratory birds. These birds have flown here from other parts of the world. Migratory birds fly to far away areas every year during a particular time because of climatic changes. They fly for laying eggs as the weather in their natural habitat becomes very cold and inhospitable. Birds who cover long distances to reach another land are known as migratory birds. 5.11 Recycling of Paper Professor Ahmad draws attention of the children to another cause of deforestation. He tells them that it takes 17 full grown trees to make one tonne of paper . Ther efore, we should save paper . Professor Ahmad also tells that paper can be recycled five to seven times for use. If each student saves at least one sheet of paper in a day, we can save many tr ees in a year . We should save, reuse used paper and recycle it. By this we not only save trees but also save energy and water needed for manufacturing paper . Moreover , the amount of har mful chemicals used in paper making will also be reduced.I wonder if there is any record of all endangered species! 2024-25 CONSER VATION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS 615.12 Reforestation Professor Ahmad suggests that the answer to deforestation is reforestation. Reforestation is restocking of the destroyed forests by planting new trees. The planted trees should generally be of the same species which were found in that for est. W e should plant at least as many trees as we cut. Reforestation can take place naturally also. If the deforested area is left undisturbed, it re- establishes itself. In natural reforestation there is no r ole of human beings. W e have already caused tremendous damage to our forests. If we have toretain our green wealth for future generations, plantation of more trees is the only option. Professor Ahmad told them that in India we have the Forest (Conservation) Act. This act is aimed at preservation and conservation of natural forests and meeting the basic needs of the people living in or near the forests. After some rest Madhavji asks the children to start heading back because it is not advisable to stay in the jungle after sunset. On getting back, Professor Ahmad and the children thank Madhavji for guiding them through this exciting experience. 2024-25 SCIENCE 62 WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT \u00dcWildlife sanctuary, national park and bio- sphere reserve are names given to the areas meant for conservation and preservation of forest and wild animals. \u00dcBiodiversity refers to the variety of living organisms in a specific area. \u00dcPlants and animals of a particular area are known as the flora and fauna of that area. \u00dcEndemic species are found only in a particular area. \u00dcEndangered species are those which are facing the danger of extinction. \u00dcRed Data Book contains a record of endangered species. \u00dcMigration is the phenomenon of movement of a species from its own habitat to some other habitat for a particular time period every year for a specific purpose like breeding. \u00dcWe should save, r euse and r ecycle paper to save trees, ener gy and water . \u00dcReforestation is the restocking of destroyed forests by planting new trees.

{"chapter": "6", "title": "Chapter 6: 6. Reproduction in Animals", "content": "REPRODUCTION IN ANIMALS REPRODUCTION IN ANIMALS Do you recall the processes of digestion, circulation and respiration which you have studied in your previous classes? These processes are essential for the survival of every individual. Y ou have also lear nt about the process of reproduction in plants. Reproduction is essential for the continuation of a species. Imagine what would have happened if organisms had not r eproduced. Y ou will r ealise that reproduction is very important as it ensures the continuation of similar kinds of individuals, generation after generation. You have alr eady lear nt in your previous class about reproduction in plants. In this chapter , we shall lear n how reproduction takes place in animals. 6.1 Modes of Reproduction Have you seen the young ones of dif ferent animals? T ry to name some of the young ones by completing Table 6.1 shown in examples at S. No. 1 and 5. You must have seen the young ones of various animals being born. Can you tell how chicks and caterpillars are born? How are kittens and puppies born? Do you think that these young ones looked the same before they were born as they do now? Let us find out.Just as in plants, there are two modes by which animals reproduce. These are: (i)Sexual reproduction, and (ii)Asexual reproduction. 6.2 Sexual Reproduction Try to r ecall r eproduction in plants which you studied in Class VII. Y ou will remember that plants that reproduce sexually have male and female reproductive parts. Can you name these parts? In animals also, males and females have different reproductive parts or organs. Like plants, the reproductive parts in animals also produce gametes that fuse to form a zygote. It is the zygote which develops into a new individual. This type of reproduction beginning from the fusion of male and female gametes is called sexual reproduction . Let us find out the reproductive partsTable 6.1 S. No. Animal Young one 1. Human Baby 2. Cat 3. Dog 4. Butterfly 5. Hen Chick 6. Cow 7. Frog 2024-25 in humans and study the process of reproduction in them. Male Reproductive Organs The male reproductive organs include a pair of testes (singular , testis), two sper m ducts and a penis (Fig. 6.1). The testes produce the male gametes called sperms . Millions of sperms are produced by the testes. Look at Fig. 6.2 which shows the picture of a sperm. Though sperms are very small in size, each has a head, a middle piece and a tail. Does it appear to be a single cell? Indeed, eachsperm is a single cell with all the usual cell components. Fig. 6.1: Male reproductive organs in humansWhat purpose does the tail in a sperm serve? Fig. 6.3 : Female reproductive organs in humansFemale Reproductive Organs The female reproductive organs are a pair of ovaries, oviducts (fallopian tubes) and the uterus (Fig. 6.3). The ovary produces Oviduct Ovary Uterus Head Middle piece Tail Fig. 6.2 : Human sperm REPRODUCTION IN ANIMALS 67 Sperm duct TestisPenis 2024-25 SCIENCE 68Boojho recalls that the size of eggs in animals varies. The egg may be very small as in humans, much larger as in hens. Ostrich egg is the largest! Fertilisation The first step in the process of reproduction is the fusion of a sperm and an ovum. When sperms come in contact with an egg, one of the sperms may fuse with the egg. Such fusion of the egg and the sperm is called fertilisation (Fig. 6.5). During fertilisation, the nuclei of the sperm and the egg fuse to form a single nucleus. This results in the formation of a fertilised egg or zygote (Fig. 6.6). Did Fig. 6.5 : Fertilisation Fig. 6.4 : Human OvumNucleusSperms Ovum Fusing nuclei The process of fertilisation is the meeting of an egg cell from the mother and a sper m cell fr om the father . So, the new individual inherits some characteristics from the mother and some fr om the father . Look at your brother or sister . See if you can r ecognise some characters in them similar to those of your mother or your father . Fertilisation which takes place inside the female body is called internal fertilisation . Internal fertilisation occurs in many animals including humans, cows, dogs and hens.Fig. 6.6 : Zygotefemale gametes called ova (eggs) (Fig. 6.4). In human beings, a single matured egg is released into the oviduct by one of the ovaries every month. Uterus is the part where development of the baby takes place. Like the sperm, an egg is also a single cell. you know that the zygote is the beginning of a new individual? 2024-25 REPRODUCTION IN ANIMALS 69Why do fish and frogs lay eggs in hundreds whereas a hen lays only one egg at a time? Have you heard of test tube babies? Boojho and Pahelis teacher once told them in the class that in some women oviducts are blocked. These women are unable to bear babies because sperms cannot reach the egg for fertilisation. In such cases, doctors collect freshly released egg and sperms and keep them together for a few hours for IVF or in vitro fertilisation (fertilisation outside the body). In case fertilisation occurs, the zygote is allowed to develop for about a week and then it is placed in the mothers uterus. Complete development takes place in the uterus and the baby is born like any other baby. Babies born through this technique are called test-tube babies . This term is actually misleading because babies cannot grow in test tubes.female lays hundreds of eggs. Unlike hens egg, frogs egg is not covered by a shell and it is comparatively very delicate. A layer of jelly holds the eggs together and provides protection to the eggs (Fig. 6.7). You will be surprised to know that in many animals fertili sation takes place outside the body of the female. In these animals, fertili sation takes place in water . Let us find out how this happens. Activity 6.1 Visit some ponds or slow-flowing streams during spring or rainy season. Look out for clusters of frogs eggs floating in water . Write down the colour and size of the eggs. During spring or rainy season, frogs and toads move to ponds and slow- flowing streams. When the male and female come together in water , theAs the eggs are laid, the male deposits sperms over them. Each sperm swims randomly in water with the help of its long tail. The sperms come in contact with the eggs. This results in fertili sation. This type of fertilis ation in which the fusion of a male and a female gamete takes place outside the body of the female is called external fertili sation . It is very common in aquatic animals such as fish, star fish , etc. Fig. 6.7 : Eggs of frog 2024-25 SCIENCE 70 Development of Embryo Fertilisation results in the formation of zygote which begins to develop into an embryo [Fig. 6.8(a)]. The zygote divides repeatedly to give rise to a ball of cells [Fig. 6.8(b)]. The cells then begin to form groups that develop into different tissues and organs of the body. This developing structure is termed an embryo . The embryo gets embedded in the wall of the uterus for further development [Fig. 6.8(c)]. The embryo continues to develop in the uterus. It gradually develops body Fig. 6.8 : (a) Zygote formation and development of an embryo from the zygote; (b) Ball of cells (enlarged); (c) Embedding of the embryo in the uterus (enlarged)How could a single cell become such a big individual? (b) (a) (c)Uterus Embedding embryoOvary OvulationZygote Uterus wall Developing embryo Though these animals lay hundreds of eggs and release millions of sperms, all the eggs do not get fertilised and develop into new individuals. This is because the eggs and sperms get exposed to water movement, wind and rainfall. Also, there are other animals in the pond which may feed on eggs. Thus, production of large number of eggs and sperms is necessary to ensure fertilisation of at least a few of them. 2024-25 REPRODUCTION IN ANIMALS 71parts such as hands, legs, head, eyes, ears etc. The stage of the embryo in which all the body parts can be identified is called a foetus (Fig. 6.9). When the development of the foetus is complete, the mother gives birth to the baby.place inside the egg shell during this period? After the chick is completely developed it bursts open the egg shell. In animals which undergo external fertilisation, development of the embryo takes place outside the female body. The embryos continue to grow within their egg coverings. After the embryos develop, the eggs hatch. Y ou must have seen numerous tadpoles swimming in ponds and streams. Viviparous and Oviparous Animals We have learnt that some animals give birth to young ones while some animals lay eggs which later develop into young ones. The animals which give birth to young ones are called viviparous animals. Those animals which lay eggs are called oviparous animals. The following activity will help you understand better and differentiate between viviparous and oviparous animals. Activity 6.2 Try to observe eggs of the following organisms  fr og, lizar d, butter fly or moth, hen and crow or any other bir d. Were you able to observe eggs of all of them? Make drawings of the eggs that you have observed. The eggs of a few animals are easy to observe because their mothers lay them outside their bodies. These are examples of oviparous animals. But you would not be able to collect the eggs of a dog, cow or cat. This is because they do not lay eggs. The mother gives birth to the young ones. These are examples of viviparous animals.Internal fertilisation takes place in hens also. But, do hens give birth to babies like human beings and cows? Y ou know that they do not. Then, how are chicks born? Let us find out. Soon after fertilisation, the zygote divides repeatedly and travels down the oviduct. As it travels down, many protective layers are formed around it. The hard shell that you see in a hens egg is one such pr otective layer . After the hard shell is formed around the developing embryo, the hen finally lays the egg. The embryo takes about 3 weeks to develop into a chick. Y ou must have seen the hen sitting on the eggs to provide sufficient warmth. Did you know that development of the chick takesFig. 6.9 : Foetus in the uterusUterus 2024-25 SCIENCE 72Can you now give some more examples of viviparous and oviparous animals? Young Ones to Adults The new individuals which are born or hatched from the eggs continue to grow till they become adults. In some animals, the young ones may look very different from the adults. The life cycle of frog is shown in Fig. 6.10. Observe the different stages of frog starting from the egg to the adult stage. We find that ther e are thr ee distinct stages, that is, egg  tadpole (larva)  adult. Dont the tadpoles look so different from the adults? Can you imagine that these tadpoles would some day become frogs?The tadpoles transform into adults capable of jumping and swimming. The transformation of the larva into an adult through drastic changes is called metamorphosis . What about the changes that we observe in our body as we grow? Do you think we too undergo metamorphosis? In human beings, body parts similar to those present in the adults are present from the time of birth. 6.3 Asexual Reproduction So far , we have lear nt about r eproduction in some familiar animals. But what about very small animals like hydra and microscopic organisms like amoeba? Do you know how they reproduce? Let us find out.

Observe them using hand lens or a microscope. Look out for any bulges from the parent body. Count the number of bulges that you see in different slides. Also, note the size of the bulges. Draw the diagram of hydra, as you see it. Compare it with the Fig. 6.11.Fig. 6.11 : Budding in Hydra Fig. 6.12 : Binary fission in Amoeba(a) (b) (c) (d)Dividing nucleus Daughter amoebaeIn each hydra, there may be one or more bulges. These bulges are the developing new individuals and they are called buds. Recall the presence of buds in yeast. In hydra too the new individuals develop as outgrowths from a single parent. This type of reproduction in which only a single parent is involved is called asexual reproduction . Since new individuals develop from the buds in hydra, this type of asexual reproduction is called budding . Another method of asexual reproduction is observed in the microscopic organism, amoeba. Let us see how this happens. You have alr eady lear nt about the structur e of amoeba. Y ou will r ecall that amoeba is a single-celled organism [Fig. 6.12(a)]. It begins the process of reproduction by the division of its nucleus into two nuclei [Fig. 6.12(b)]. This is followed by division of its body into two, each part receiving a nucleus [Fig. 6.12(c)]. Finally, two amoebae are produced from one parent amoeba [Fig. 6.12(d)]. This type of asexual 2024-25 SCIENCE 74Story of Dolly, the Clone Cloning is the production of an exact copy of a cell, any other living part, or a complete organism. Cloning of an animal was successfully performed for the first time by Ian Wilmut and his colleagues at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, Scotland. They successfully cloned a sheep named Dolly [Fig. 6.13 (c)]. Dolly was born on 5th July 1996 and was the first mammal to be cloned. (a) Finn Dorsett sheep (b) Scottish blackface ewe (c) Dolly Fig. 6.13 During the process of cloning Dolly, a cell was collected from the mammary gland of a female Finn Dorsett sheep [Fig. 6.13 (a)]. Simultaneously, an egg was obtained from a Scottish blackface ewe [Fig. 6.13 (b)]. The nucleus was removed from the egg. Then, the nucleus of the mammary gland cell from the Finn Dorsett sheep was inserted into the egg of the Scottish blackface ewe whose nucleus had been removed. The egg thus produced was implanted into the Scottish blackface ewe. Development of this egg followed normally and finally Dolly was born. Though Dolly was given birth by the Scottish blackface ewe, it was found to be absolutely identical to the Finn Dorsett sheep from which the nucleus was taken. Since the nucleus from the egg of the Scottish blackface ewe was removed, Dolly did not show any character of the Scottish blackface ewe. Dolly was a healthy clone of the Finn Dorsett sheep and produced several offspring of her own through normal sexual means. Unfortunately, Dolly died on 14th February 2003 due to a certain lung disease. Since Dolly, several attempts have been made to produce cloned mammals. However , many die befor e birth or die soon after birth. The cloned animals ar e many-a-times found to be born with severe abnormalities. reproduction in which an animal reproduces by dividing into two individuals is called binary fission . Apart from budding and binary fission,there are other methods by which a single parent reproduces young ones. You will study about these in your higher classes. 2024-25 REPRODUCTION IN ANIMALS 75 KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION BINARY FISSION BUDDING EGGS EMBRYO EXTERNAL FERTILISA TION FERTILISA TION FOETUS INTERNAL FERTILISA TION METAMORPHOSIS OVIPAROUS ANIMALS SEXUAL REPRODUCTION SPERMS VIVIP AROUS ANIMALS ZYGOTE WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT \u00dcThere are two modes by which animals repro- duce.

After a day or so you may see several hydra clinging to the sides of the jar . Hydra is transparent, jelly-like and with tentacles. It clings to the jar with the base of its body. If the jar is shaken, the hydra will contract instantly into a small blob, at the same time drawing its tentacles in. Now take out few hydras from the jar and put them on a watch glass. Using a hand lens or a binocular or dissection microscope, observe the changes that are taking place in their body. Note down your observations. 3.The eggs we get from the market are generally the unfertilised ones. In case you wish to observe a developing chick embryo, get a fertilised egg from the poultry or hatchery which has been incubated for 36 hours or mor e. You may then be able to see a white disc-like structur e on the yolk. This is the developing embryo. Sometimes if the heart and blood vessels have developed you may even see a red spot. 4.Talk to a doctor . Find out how twinning occurs.

An interesting organisation is observed in a honey bee hive, a colony of several thousand bees. Only one bee i n the colony lays eggs. This bee is called the queen bee. All other female bees are worker bees. Their main job is to build the hive, look after the young and feed the queen bee adequately to keep her healthy so that she can lay eggs. A queen bee lays thousands of eggs. The fertili sed eggs hatch into females, while the unfertili sed eggs give rise to males , called drones. It is the job of the worker bees to maintain the temperature of the hive at around 35 C to incubate the eggs. 2024-25"}
{"chapter": "7", "title": "Chapter 7: 7. Reaching the Age of Adolesence", "content": "In the pr evious chapter , you have learnt how animals reproduce. It is only after growing up to a certain age that human beings and many other animals can reproduce. Why can humans reproduce only after a certain age? In this chapter , you will lear n about changes that take place in the human body after which a person becomes capable of reproduction. In Chapter 6, you have learnt about human reproductive organs. Here, we shall discuss the role that hormones play in bringing about changes that make a child grow into an adult. 7.1 Adolescence and Puberty Boojho was celebrating his 12th birthday. After his friends left, Boojho and Paheli began chatting with their parents. Paheli studies in an all-girls school. She started laughing. She remarked that many of Boojhos school friends, whom she met after a year , had suddenly shot up in height. Some of them were looking very funny with a hairy line above their lips. Her mother explained that the boys had grown up. Growth begins from the day one is born. But upon crossing the age of 10 or 11, there is a sudden spurt in growth which becomes noticeable. The changes taking place in the body are part of growing up. They indicate that you areI wonder how long this period marked by changes in the body will last! no longer a child but are on the way to becoming an adult. It is a strange period of life when you are neither a child nor an adult. I wonder whether this period between childhood and adulthood had a special name! Growing up is a natural process. The period of life, when the body undergoes changes, leading to reproductive maturity, is called adolescence. Adolescence begins around the age of 11 and lasts upto 18 or 19 years of age. Since this period covers the teens (13 to 18 or 19 years of age), adolescents are also called teenagers. In girls, adolescence may begin a year or two earlier than in boys. Also, the period of adolescence varies from person to person. The human body undergoes several changes during adolescence. These changes mark the onset of puberty . The most important change which marks puberty is that boys and girls become capable of reproduction. Puberty ends when an adolescent reaches reproductive maturity.

For example, by the age 11, a boy has reached 81 of his probable full height, while a girl has reached 88 of her full height. These figures are only representative and there may be individual variations. Use the Table for your friends and work out how tall they are likely to be. Find out who is likely to beCalculation for full height (cm) ( )100Presentheight cm of fullheightatthisage (as given in the chart) Example: A boy is 9 years old and 120 cm tall. At the end of the growth period he is likely to be 12010075 cm  160 cm tallthe tallest and who might be the shortest in your class. 2024-25 REACHING THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE 81There is no need for Paheli to worry. All parts of the body do not grow at the same rate. Sometimes the arms and legs or hands and feet of adolescents look oversized and out of proportion with the body. But soon the other parts catch up and result in a proportionate body. You must have noticed that height of an individual is more or less similar to that of some family member . This is because height depends on the genes inherited fr om par ents. It is, however , very important to eat the right kind of food during these growing years. This helps the bones, muscles and other parts of the body get adequate nourishment for gr owth. Y ou will find nutritional needs of adolescents discussed later in the lesson. Change in Body Shape Have you noticed that boys in your class have broader shoulders and wider chests than boys in junior classes? This is because they have entered the age of puberty when shoulders generally broaden as a result of growth. In girls, the region below the waist becomes wider . In boys, the muscles of the body grow more prominently than in the girls. Thus, changes occurring in adolescent boys and girls are different. Voice Change Did you notice that sometimes the voice of some of the boys in your class cracks? At puberty, the voice box or the larynx begins to grow. Boys develop larger voice boxes. The growing voice box in boys can be seen as a protruding part of the throatActivity 7.2 Use the data given in Activity 7.1 to draw a graph. Take age on the X-axis and per cent growth in height on the Y-axis. Highlight the point representing your age on the graph. Find out the percentage of height you have already reached. Calculate the height you might eventually reach. Tally your graph with the one given here (Fig. 7.1). Fig. 7.1 : Graph showing percentage of height with age I am worried. Though I have become taller , my face looks much smaller compared to my body. Initially, girls grow faster than boys but by about 18 years of age, both reach their maximum height. The rate of growth in height varies in different individuals. Some may grow suddenly at puberty and then slow down, while others may grow gradually. 2024-25 SCIENCE 82and pimples on the face at this time because of the increased activity of these glands in the skin. Development of Sex Organs Look up Fig. 6.1 and 6.3 of the previous lesson which show sex organs of humans. At puberty, male sex organs like the testes and penis develop completely. The testes also begin to produce sperms. In girls, the ovaries enlarge and eggs begin to mature. Also ovaries start releasing mature eggs. Reaching Mental, Intellectual and Emotional Maturity Adolescence is also a period of change in a persons way of thinking. Adolescents are more independent than before and are also self conscious. Intellectual development takes place and they tend to spend considerable time thinking. In fact, it is often the time in ones life when the brain has the greatest capacity for learning. Sometimes, however , an adolescent may feel insecure while trying to adjust to the changes in the body and mind. But as adolescent learners, you should know that there is no reason to feel insecure. These changes are a natural part of growing up. 7.3 Secondary Sexual Characters You have lear nt in Chapter 6, that testes and ovaries are the reproductive organs. They produce the gametes, that is, sperms and ova. In girls, breasts begin to develop at pubertyMany of my classmates have a hoarse voice. Now I know why? Fig. 7.2 : Adams apple in a grown up boycalled Adams apple (Fig. 7.2). In girls, the larynx is hardly visible from the outside because of its small size. Generally, girls have a high pitched voice, whereas boys have a deep voice. In adolescent boys, sometimes, the muscles of the growing voice box go out of control and the voice becomes hoarse. This state may remain for a few days or weeks after which the voice becomes normal. A few glands such as sweat glands, oil glands and salivary glands release their secretions through ducts. Endocrine glands release hormones directly into the bloodstream. So, they are also termed ductless glands.Increased Activity of Sweat and Sebaceous Glands During puberty the secretion of sweat glands and sebaceous glands (oil glands) increases. Many young people get acneAdams apple 2024-25 REACHING THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE 83and boys begin to gr ow facial hair , that is, moustaches and beard. As these features help to distinguish the male from the female they are called secondary sexual characters . Boys also develop hair on their chest. In both, boys and girls, hair grows under the arms and in the region above the thighs or the pubic region. Paheli and Boojho have now understood that puberty marks the beginning of the reproductive period when one becomes capable of reproduction. But they want to know if reproductive life, once begun, continues, or it ends some time.The testes and ovaries secrete sex hormones. Y ou have just lear nt that these hormones are responsible for the male and female secondary sexual characters. Further , the sex hor mones are under the control of hormones from the pituitary gland (Fig. 7.3). The pituitary secretes many hormones, one of which makes ova mature in the ovaries and sperms form in the testes. Both Boojho and Paheli wish to know what initiates changes at puberty. Fig. 7.3 : The onset of puberty is controlled by hormonesThe changes which occur at adolescence are controlled by hormones. Hormones are chemical substances. These are secretions from endocrine glands , or endocrine system. The male hormone or testosterone begins to be released by the testes at the onset of puberty. This causes changes in boys about which you have just learnt, for example, the growth of facial hair . Once puberty is r eached in girls, ovaries begin to produce the female hormone or estrogen which makes the breasts develop. Milk secreting glands or mammary glands develop inside the breasts. The production of these hormones is under the control of another hormone secreted from an endocrine gland called pituitary gland . 7.4 Role of Hormones in Initiating Reproductive Function Endocrine glands release hormones into the bloodstream to reach a particular body part called target site . The target site responds to the hormone. There are many endocrine glands or ductless glands in the body. 2024-25 SCIENCE 847.5 Reproductive Phase of Life in Humans Adolescents become capable of reproduction when their testes and ovaries begin to produce gametes. The capacity for maturation and production of gametes lasts for a much longer time in males than in females. In females, the reproductive phase of life begins at puberty (10 to 12 years of age) and generally lasts till the age of approximately 45 to 50 years. The ova begin to mature with the onset of puberty. One ovum matures and is released by one of the ovaries once in about 28 to 30 days. During this period, the wall of the uterus becomes thick so as to receive the egg, in case it is fertilised and begins to develop. This results in pregnancy. If fertilisation does not occur , the released egg, and the thickened lining of the uterus along with its blood vessels are shed off. This causes bleeding in women which is called menstruation . Menstruation occurs once in about 28 to 30 days. The first menstrual flow begins at puberty and is termed menarche . At 45 to 50 years of age, the menstrual cycle stops. Stoppage of menstruation is termed menopause. Initially, menstrual cycle may be irr egular . It take some time to become r egular .Menstrual cycle is controlled by hormones. The cycle includes the maturation of the egg, its release, thickening of uterine wall and its breakdown if pregnancy does not occur . In case the egg is fertilised it begins to divide and then gets embedded in the uterus for further development as you have learnt in Chapter 6 (Fig. 6.8). 7.6 How is the Sex of the Baby Determined? I heard my mother and my aunt talking about my cousin who is going to have a baby. They were discussing whether she would give birth to a boy or a girl. I wonder what makes the fertilised egg develop either into a boy or a girl! Paheli says that the reproductive life of a woman lasts from menarche to menopause. Is she right?Boy or Girl? Inside the fertilised egg or zygote is the instruction for determining the sex of the baby. This instruction is present in the thread-like structures, called chromosomes in the fertilised egg. Chromosomes are present inside the nucleus of every cell. All human beings have 23 pairs of chromosomes in the nuclei of their cells. Two chromosomes out of these are the sex chromosomes, named X and Y . A female has two X chromosomes, while a male has one X and one Y chromosome. The gametes (egg and sperm) have only one set of chromosomes. The unfertilised egg always has one X chromosome. But 2024-25 REACHING THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE 85sperms are of two kinds. One kind has an X chromosome, and the other kind has a Y chromosome. See Fig. 7.4. When a sperm containing X chromosome fertilises the egg, the zygote would have two X chromosomes and develop into a female child. If the sperm contributes a Y chromosome to the egg (ovum) at fertilisation, the zygote would develop into a male child.and ovaries to produce their hormones. You have alr eady lear nt that the pituitary gland is an endocrine gland. It is attached to the brain. Apart from the pituitary, the testes and the ovaries, there are other endocrine glands in the body such as thyroid, pancreas and adrenals (Fig. 7.5). Fig. 7.4 : Sex determination in humansboy girlsperms eggs Now you know that the sex chromosomes of the father determine the sex of an unborn baby. The belief that the mother is responsible for the sex of her baby is completely wrong and to blame her for this is totally unjustified. 7.7 Hormones other than Sex Hormones Look at Fig. 7.3 again. The hormones secreted by the pituitary stimulate testesFig. 7.5 :Position of endocrine glands in the human body pituitary gland thyroid gland adrenal gland pancreas testisposition of the ovary in the female Boojho and Paheli had once visited their aunt who was a doctor and remembered that a boy named Kaka had a very big and bulging throat. Their aunt had told them that Kaka was suffering from goitre, a disease of the thyroid gland . Kakas thyroid gland was not producing the hormone thyroxine . 2024-25 SCIENCE 86Their aunt also told them that their uncle was suffering from diabetes because his pancreas was not producing the hormone insulin in sufficient quantities. Boojho and Paheli then asked their aunt about the adrenal glands, which are also shown in the chart hung on the wall of her clinic. The aunt told them that adrenal glands secrete hormones which maintain the correct salt balance in the blood. Adrenals also produce the hormone adrenalin. It helps the body to adjust to stress when one is very angry, embarrassed or worried. Thyroid and adrenals secrete their hormones when they receive orders from the pituitary through its hormones. Pituitary also secretes growth hormone which is necessary for the normal growth of a person.controlled by insect hormones. In a frog, it is controlled by thyroxine, the hormone produced by thyroid. Thyroxine production requires the presence of iodine in water . If the water in which the tadpoles are growing does not contain sufficient iodine, the tadpoles cannot become adults. 7.8 Role of Hormones in Completing the Life History of Insects and Frogs You have alr eady lear nt about the life cycle of the frog. The tadpole passes through certain stages to become a frog (Chapter 6). This change from larva to adult is called metamorphosis (Fig. 6.10). Metamorphosis in insects isCollect information from magazines or from doctors and prepare a note on the importance of consuming iodised salt. Y ou can also look for this information on the internet. 7.9 Reproductive Health The physical and mental well being of an individual is regarded as an individuals health. To keep the body healthy, every human being, at any age, needs to have a balanced diet. The person must also observe personal hygiene and undertake adequate physical exercise. During adolescence, however , these become even more essential as the body is growing. Nutritional Needs of the Adolescents Adolescence is a stage of rapid growth and development. Hence the diet for an Are there hormones in other animals also? Have they any role to play in reproduction? If people do not have enough iodine in their diet, will they get goitre caused by lack of thyroxine? Activity 7.3 2024-25 REACHING THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE 87adolescent has to be carefully planned. You have alr eady lear nt what a balanced diet is. Recall that a balanced diet means that the meals include proteins, carbohydrates, fats and vitamins in requisite proportions. Our Indian meal of rotirice, dal (pulses) and vegetables is a balanced meal. Milk is a balanced food in itself. Fruits also provide nourishment. For infants, mothers milk provides all the nourishment that they need. Iron builds blood and iron-rich food such as leafy vegetables, jaggery, meat, citrus, Indian gooseberry (amla) are good for adolescents. Check items for lunch and dinner in your meal. Is the meal balanced and nutritious? Does it include cereals which give energy and milk, meat, nuts and pulses which provide proteins for growth? Also, does it include fats and sugar that give energy? What about fruits and vegetables which are protective foods? Chips and packed or tinned snacks, though very tasty should never replace regular meals as they do not have adequate nutritional value. Activity 7.4 Make a group with your friends. Write down the items of food in your breakfast, lunch and dinner you had on the previous day. Identify the items responsible for proper growth. Also identified the junk food that you consumed the previous day.Personal Hygiene Everyone should have a bath at least once everyday. It is more necessary for teenagers because the increased activity of sweat glands sometimes makes the body smelly. All parts of the body should be washed and cleaned everyday. If meat vegetables fruitsmilk and eggs grains Fig. 7.6 : Nutritious items of foodActivity 7.5 Get ideas from the pictures given in Fig.7.6. Prepare charts or posters and paste them in the class so that you are aware of the diet for adolescents. Y ou may use your creative ideas and present it like an advertisement. Y ou may even organise a competition on this topic. 2024-25 SCIENCE 88cleanliness is not maintained there are chances of catching bacterial infection. Girls should take special care of cleanliness during the time of menstrual flow. They should keep track of their menstrual cycle and be prepared for the onset of menstruation. Use sanitary napkin or clean homemade pads. Change pads after every 45 hours as per the requirement. Physical exercise Walking and playing in fresh air keeps the body fit and healthy. All young boys and girls should take walks, exercise and play outdoor games.Activity 7.6 Collect data on the number of children in your class who exercise regularly and who do not exercise regularly. Did you notice any difference in their fitness and health? Prepare a report on the benefits of regular exercise. Say NO to Drugs Adolescence is a period of much activity in the body and mind which is a normal part of growing up. So do not feel confused or insecure. If anybody suggests that you will get relief if you take some drugs, just say No unless pr escribed by the doctor . Drugs are addictive. If you take them once, you feel like taking them again and again. They harm the body in the long run. They ruin health and happiness. You must have hear d about AIDS which is caused by a dangerous virus, HIV. This virus can pass on to a normal person from an infected person by sharing the syringes used for injecting drugs. It can also be transmitted to an infant from the infected mother through her milk. The virus can also be transmitted through sexual contact with a person infected with HIV . Adolescent Pregnancy You might be knowing that in our country, the legal age for marriage is 18 years for girls and 21 years for boys. This is because teenage mothers are not prepared mentally or physically for motherhood. Early marriage and motherhood cause health problems in the mother and the child. It also curtails employment opportunities for the young woman and may cause mental agony as she is not ready for responsibilities of motherhood.Myths, Taboos, Dos and Donts You have lear nt her e and fr om Chapter 6 the scientific facts related to human reproduction. There are many wrong notions which you should now be able to discard as informed adolescents. For example, there are myths and taboos regarding bodily changes that adolescents experience. Some of these are given below and you can now argue why these are myths and not facts. 1.A girl becomes pregnant if she looks at boys during menstruation. 2.The mother is responsible for the sex of her child. 3.A girl should not be allowed to work in the kitchen during menstruation. You may come acr oss many other myths and taboos.

{"chapter": "8", "title": "Chapter 8: 8. Force and Pressure", "content": "FORCE AND PRESSURE FORCE AND PRESSURE In Class VII, you have learnt how objects move. Do you recall how we can decide whether an object is moving faster than the other? What does the distance moved by an object in unit time indicate? Y ou also know that a moving object like a ball rolling on the ground slows down. Sometimes it may change its direction of motion. It is also possible that the ball may slow down and also change its direction. Have you ever wondered what makes an object slow down or go faster , or change its direction of motion? Let us recall some of our everyday experiences. What do you do to make a football move? What do you do to make a moving ball move faster? How does a goalkeeper stop a ball ? A hockey player changes the direction of the moving ball with a flick of the stick . How do fielders stop a ball hitby a batsman? (Fig. 8.1). In all these situations the ball is either made to move faster or slower or its direction of motion is changed. We often say that a for ce has been applied on a ball when it is kicked, pushed, thrown or flicked. What is a force? What can it do to bodies on which it is applied? W e shall seek answers to such questions in this chapter . 8.1 Force  A Push or a Pull Actions like picking, opening, shutting, kicking, hitting, lifting, flicking, pushing, pulling are often used to describe certain tasks. Each of these actions usually results in some kind of change in the state of motion of an object. Can these terms be replaced with one or more terms? Let us find out. (a) (b) (c) Fig. 8.1 : (a) A goal keeper saving a goal, (b) A hockey player flicking a ball, and (c) A fielder stopping a ball 2024-25 SCIENCE 94 Activity 8.1 Table 8.1 gives some examples of familiar situations involving motion of objects.

Opening a drawerPushing Pulling Lifting  Yes Yes Table 8.1 : Identifying Actions as Push or Pull I learnt in Class VI that a magnet attracts a piece of iron towards it. Is attraction also a pull? What about repulsion between similar poles of two magnets? Is it a pull or a push?Do you notice that each of the actions can be grouped as a pull or a push or both? Can we infer from this, that to move an object, it has to be pushed or pulled? In science, a push or a pull on an object is called a force . Thus, we can say that the motion imparted to objects was due to the action of a force. When does a force come into play? Let us find out. Pull 2024-25 FORCE AND PRESSURE 95Fig. 8.3 (b) : Who is pulling whom ? 8.2 Forces are due to an Interaction Suppose a man is standing behind a stationary car [Fig.8.2(a)]. Will the car move due to his presence? Suppose the man now begins to push the car [Fig.8.2(b)], that is, he applies a force on it. The car may begin to move in theFig. 8.3 shows three situations that may be familiar to you. Can you decide who is pulling and who is pushing in these cases? In Fig. 8.3 (a), both the girls appear to push each other while Fig. 8.2 (b) : A car being pushed by a man Fig. 8.3 (a) : Who is pushing whom? direction of the applied force. Note that the man has to push the car to make it move.Fig. 8.2(a) : A man standing behind a stationary car Fig. 8.3 (c) : Who is pulling whom ? the pair of girls in Fig. 8.3 (b) are trying to pull each other . Similarly, the cow and the man in Fig. 8.3 (c) appear to pull each other . The girls in the two situations shown here are applying force on each other . Is it also true for the man and the cow? From these examples, we can infer that at least two objects must interact for a force to come into play. Thus, an interaction of one object with another object results in a force between the two objects. 2024-25 SCIENCE 96Does it mean that the net force on an object is zero if the two forces acting on it in opposite directions are equal? rope in their direction. Sometimes the rope simply does not move. Is it not similar to the situation shown in Fig. 8.3 (b)? The team that pulls har der, that is, applies a larger force, finally wins the game. What do these examples suggest about the nature of force? Forces applied on an object in the same dir ection add to one another . Now recall what happened when you and your friend pushed the heavy box in the same direction in Activity 8.2. If the two forces act in the opposite directions on an object, the net force acting on it is the difference between the two forces . What did you observe in Activity 8.2 when both of you were pushing the heavy box from opposite directions? Recall that in the tug-of-war when two teams pull equally hard, the rope does not move in any direction. So, we learn that a force could be larger or smaller than the other or equal to each other . The strength of a force is usually expr essed by its magnitude . We have also to specify the direction in which a force acts. Also, if the direction or the magnitude of the applied force changes, its effect also changes.Activity 8.2 Choose a heavy object like a table or a box, which you can move only by pushing har d. Try to push it all by yourself. Can you move it? Now ask one of your friends to help you in pushing it in the same direction [Fig. 8.4(a)]. Is it easier to move it now? Can you explain why? Now push the same object, but ask your friend to push it from the opposite side [Fig. 8.4 (b)]. Does the object move? If it does, note the direction in which it moves. Can you guess which one of you is applying a larger force? Fig. 8.4 : Two friends pushing a heavy load (a) in the same direction, (b) in opposite direction(a) (b)8.3 Exploring Forces Let us try to learn more about forces. Fig. 8.5 : The rope may not move if the two teams pull at it with equal force Have you ever seen a game of tug-of war? In this game two teams pull at a rope in opposite directions (Fig. 8.5). Members of both the teams try to pull the 2024-25 FORCE AND PRESSURE 97In general, more than one force may be acting on an object. However , the effect on the object is due to the net force acting on it. 8.4 A Force can Change the State of Motion Let us now find out what happens when a force acts on an object. Activity 8.3 Take a rubber ball and place it on a level sur face such as a table top or a concr ete floor . Now, gently push the ball along the level sur face (Fig. 8.6). Does the ball begin to move? Push the ball again while it is still moving. Is there any change in its speed? Does it increase or decrease? Next, place your palm in front of the moving ball. Remove your palm as soon as the moving ball touches it. Does your palm apply a force on the ball? What happens to the speed of the ball now? Does it increase or decrease? What would happen if you let your palm hold the moving ball? Fig. 8.6 : A ball at rest begins to move when a force is applied on itI have seen children competing with one another in moving a rubber tyre or a ring by pushing it (Fig. 8.7). I now understand why the speed of the tyre increases whenever it is pushed. Fig. 8.7 : To move a tyre faster it has to be pushed repeatedly You might r ecall similar situations. For example, while taking a penalty kick in football, the player applies a force on the ball. Before being hit, the ball was at rest and so its speed was zero. The applied force makes the ball move towards the goal. Suppose, the goalkeeper dives or jumps up to save the goal. By his action the goalkeeper tries to apply a force on the moving ball. The force applied by him can stop or deflect the ball, saving a goal being scored. If the goalkeeper succeeds in stopping the ball, its speed decreases to zero. These observations suggest that a force applied on an object may change its speed. If the force applied on the object is in the direction of its motion, the speed of the object increases. If the force is applied in the direction opposite to the direction of motion, then it results in a decrease in the speed of the object. 2024-25 SCIENCE 98Let us consider some more examples. In a game of volleyball, players often push the moving ball to their team mates to make a winning move. Sometimes the ball is returned to the other side of the court by pushing or smashing it. In cricket, a batsman plays his or her shot by applying a force on the ball with the bat. Is there any change in the direction of motion of the ball in these cases? In all these examples the speed and the direction of the moving ball change due to the application of a force. Can you give a few more examples of this kind? A change in either the speed of an object, or its direction of motion, or both, is described as a change in its state of motion . Thus, a force may bring a change in the state of motion of an object. Fig. 8.8 : (a) A ball set in motion by pushing it along a level surface and (b) the direction of motion of the ball after it strikes the ruler placed in its path(a)State of Motion The state of motion of an object is described by its speed and the direction of motion. The state of rest is considered to be the state of zero speed. An object may be at rest or in motion; both are its states of motion.Paheli is curious to know whether application of a force can only change the speed of an object. Let us find out. Activity 8.4 Take a ball and place it on a level surface as you did in Activity 8.3. Make the ball move by giving it a push [Fig. 8.8(a)]. Now place a ruler in its path as shown in Fig. 8.8(b). In doing so, you would apply a force on the moving ball. Does the ball continue to move in the same direction after it strikes the ruler? Repeat the activity and try to obstruct the moving ball by placing the ruler in such a way that it makes different angles to its path. In each case note your observations about the direction of motion of the ball after it strikes the ruler . (b)Does it mean that the application of a force would always result in a change in the state of motion of the object? Let us find out. It is common experience that many a time application of force does not result in a change in the state of motion. For example, a heavy box may not move at all even if you apply the maximum force that you can exert. Again, no effect of force is observed when you try to push a wall. 2024-25 FORCE AND PRESSURE 998.5 Force can Change the Shape of an Object Description of SituationHow to Apply ForceDiagram Action of Force Change in State of MotionChange in Shape Yes No Yes No Pressing it down with your hands.

By putting a weight at the centre of the scale.Table 8.2 : Studying the Effect of Force on Objects Activity 8.5 Some situations have been given in Column 1 of Table 8.2 in which objects are not free to move. Column 2 of the Table suggests the manner in which a force can be applied on each object while Column 3 shows a diagram of the action. T ry to observe the ef fect of for ce in as many situations as possible. Y ou can also add similar situations using available material from your environment. Note your observations in Columns 4 and 5 of the Table. A lump of dough on a plate. Spring fixed to the seat of a bicycle. A rubber band suspended from a hooknail fixed on a wall. A plastic or metal scale placed between two bricks. 2024-25 SCIENCE 100 Fig. 8.9 : Muscular force of animals is used to carry out many difficult tasksWhat do you conclude from the observations noted in Table 8.2? What happens when you apply a force on an inflated balloon by pressing it between your palms? What happens to the shape of a ball of dough when it is rolled to make a chapati ? What happens when you press a rubber ball placed on a table? In all these examples you saw that the application of force on an object may change its shape . Having per formed all the above activities, you would have realised that a force lmay make an object move from rest. lmay change the speed of an object if it is moving. lmay change the direction of motion of an object. lmay bring about a change in the shape of an object. lmay cause some or all of these effects. While a force may cause one or more of these effects, it is important to remember that none of these actions can take place without the action of a force. Thus, an object cannot move by itself, it cannot change speed by itself, it cannot change direction by itself and its shape cannot change by itself. 8.6 Contact Forces Muscular Force Can you push or lift a book lying on a table without touching it? Can you lift a bucket of water without holding it? Generally, to apply a force on an object, your body has to be in contact with the object. The contact may also be with thehelp of a stick or a piece of rope. When we push an object like a school bag or lift a bucket of water, wher e does the force come from? This force is caused by the action of muscles in our body. The force resulting due to the action of muscles is known as the muscular force . It is the muscular force that enables us to perform all activities involving movement or bending of our body. In Class VII you have learnt that in the process of digestion the food gets pushed through the alimentary canal. Could it be a muscular force that does it? You also know that lungs expand and contract while we inhale and exhale air during breathing. Where are these muscles located which make breathing possible? Can you list a few more examples of the force exerted by the muscles in our body? Animals also make use of muscular force to carry out their physical activities and other tasks. Animals like bullocks, horses, donkeys and camels are used to perfor m various tasks for us. In performing these tasks they use muscular force (Fig. 8.9). 2024-25 FORCE AND PRESSURE 101Since muscular force can be applied only when it is in contact with an object, it is also called a contact force . Are there other types of contact forces? Let us find out. Friction Recall some of your experiences. A ball rolling along the ground gradually slows down and finally comes to rest. When we stop pedalling a bicycle, it gradually slows down and finally comes to a stop. A car or a scooter also comes to rest once its engine is switched off. Similarly, a boat comes to rest if we stop rowing it. Can you add some more such experiences? In all these situations no force appears to be acting on the objects, yet their speed gradually decreases and they come to rest after some time. What causes a change in their state of motion? Could some force be acting on them! Can you guess the direction in which the force must be acting in each case? The force responsible for changing the state of motion of objects in all these examples is the force of friction . It is the force of friction between the sur face of the ball and the ground that brings the moving ball to rest. Similarly, friction between water and the boat brings it to a stop once you stop rowing. The force of friction always acts on all the moving objects and its direction is always opposite to the direction of motion. Since the force of friction arises due to contact between sur faces, it is also an example of a contact for ce. You will learn more about this force in Chapter 9. You may be wondering whether it is essential for the agent applying a forceon an object to be always in contact with it. Let us find out. 8.7 Non-contact Forces Magnetic Force Activity 8.6 Take a pair of bar magnets. Place the longer side of one of the magnets over three round shaped pencils or wooden rollers as shown in Fig. 8.10. Now bring one end of the other magnet near the end of the magnet placed on the rollers. Make sure that the two magnets do not touch each other . Observe what happens. Next, bring the other end of the magnet near the same end of the magnet placed on the rollers (Fig.8.10). Note what happens to the magnet placed on the rollers every time another magnet is brought near it. Fig. 8.10 : Observing attraction and repulsion between two magnets 2024-25 SCIENCE 102 Fig. 8.11 : A straw rubbed with paper attracts another straw but repels it if it has also been rubbed with a sheet of paper A straw is said to have acquired electrostatic charge after it has been rubbed with a sheet of paper . Such a straw is an example of a charged body. The force exerted by a charged body on another charged or uncharged body is known as electrostatic force . This force comes into play even when the bodies are not in contact. The electrostatic force, therefore, is another example of a non-contact for ce. You will learn more about electric charges in Chapter 12. Gravitational Force You know that a coin or a pen falls to the ground when it slips off your hand. Leaves and fruits also fall to the ground when they get detached from the plant. Have you ever wondered why it is so? When the coin is held in your hand it is at rest. As soon as it is released, it begins to move downwards. It is clear that the state of motion of the coin undergoes a change. Can this happen without a force acting on it? Which is this force?Does the magnet on the rollers begin to move when the other magnet is brought near it? Does it always move in the direction of the approaching magnet? What do these observations suggest? Does it mean that some force must be acting between the two magnets? You have lear nt in Class VI that like poles of two magnets repel each other and unlike poles attract each other . Attraction or repulsion between objects can also be seen as another form of pull or push. Do you have to bring the magnets in contact for observing the force between them? A magnet can exert a force on another magnet without being in contact with it. The force exerted by a magnet is an example of a non-contact force . Similarly, the force exerted by a magnet on a piece of iron is also a non-contact force. Electrostatic Force Activity 8.7 Take a plastic straw and cut it into nearly two equal pieces. Suspend one of the pieces from the edge of a table with the help of a piece of thread (Fig. 8.11). Now hold the other piece of straw in your hand and rub its free end with a sheet of paper . Bring the rubbed end of the straw near the suspended straw. Make sure that the two pieces do not touch each other . What do you observe? Next, rub the free end of the suspended piece of straw with a sheet of paper . Again, bring the piece of straw that was rubbed earlier with paper near the free end of the suspended straw. What do you observe now? 2024-25 FORCE AND PRESSURE 103Objects or things fall towards the earth because it pulls them. This force is called the force of gravity , or just gravity. This is an attractive force. The force of gravity acts on all objects. The force of gravity acts on all of us all the time without our being awar e of it. W ater begins to flow towards the ground as soon as we open a tap. W ater in rivers flows downward due to the force of gravity.Try cutting vegetables with a blunt knife and then with a sharp knife. Which is easier? Do you get the feeling that the area over which the force is applied (for example, the pointed end of the nail) plays a role in making these tasks easier? The force acting on a unit area of a surface is called pr essure . pressure  force  area on which it acts At this stage we consider only those forces which act perpendicular to the surface on which the pressure is to be computed.Gravity is not a property of the earth alone. In fact, every object in the universe, whether small or large, exerts a force on every other object. This force is known as the gravitational force . 8.8 Pressure Is there any relation between pressure and force? Let us find out. Try to push a nail into a wooden plank by its head. Did you succeed? T ry now to push the nail by the pointed end (Fig. 8.12). Could you do it this time? I now understand why porters place a round piece of cloth on their heads, when they have to carry heavy loads (Fig. 8.13). By doing this they increase the area of contact of the load with their head. So, the pressure on their head is reduced and they find it easier to carry the load. Fig. 8.13 : A porter carrying a heavy load Fig. 8.12 : Pushing a nail into a wooden plank 2024-25 SCIENCE 104Note that the area is in the denominator in the above expression. So, the smaller the area, larger the pressur e on a sur face for the same for ce. The area of the pointed end of the nail is much smaller than that of its head. The same force, therefore, produces a pressure sufficient to push the pointed end of the nail into the wooden plank. Can you explain now why shoulder bags are provided with broad straps and not thin strap? And, why the tools meant for cutting and piercing always have sharp edges? Do liquids and gases also exert pressure? Does it also depend on the area on which the force acts? Let us find out. 8.9 Pressure Exerted by Liquids and Gases Activity 8.8 Take a transparent glass tube or a plastic pipe. The length of the pipe tube should be about 25 cm and its diameter should be 5-7.5 cm. Also take a piece of thin sheet of a good quality rubber , say, a rubber balloon. Stretch the rubber sheet tightly over one end of the pipe. Hold the pipe at the middle, keeping it in a vertical position (Fig. 8.14). Ask one of your friends to pour some water in the pipe. Does the rubber sheet bulge out? Note also the height of the water column in the pipe. Pour some mor e water . Observe again the bulge in the rubber sheet and the height of the water column in the pipe. Repeatthis process a few more times. Can you see any relation between the amount of the bulge in the rubber sheet and the height of the water column in the pipe? Fig. 8.14 : Pressure exerted by water at the bottom of the container depends on the height of its column Activity 8.9 Take a plastic bottle. Y ou can take a discarded water or soft drink bottle. Fix a cylindrical glass tube, a few cm long near its bottom as shown in Fig. 8.15. Y ou can do so by slightly heating one end of the glass tube and then quickly inserting it near the bottom of the bottle. Make sure that the water does not leak from the joint. If there is any leakage, seal it with molten wax. Cover the mouth of the glass tube with a thin rubber sheet as you did in Activity 8.8. Now fill the bottle upto half with water . What do you observe? Why does the rubber sheet 2024-25 FORCE AND PRESSURE 105 Fig. 8.15 : A liquid exerts pressure on the walls of the container Note that the rubber sheet has been fixed on the side of the container and not at the bottom. Does the bulging of the rubber sheet in this case indicate that water exerts pressure on the sides of the container as well? Let us investigate further . Activity 8.10 Take an empty plastic bottle or a cylindrical container . You can take a used tin can or a used plastic bottle. Drill four holes all around near the bottom of the bottle. Make sure that the holes are at the same height from the bottom (Fig. 8.16). Now fill the bottle with water . What do you observe? Do the different streams of water coming out of the holes fall at the same distance from the bottle? What does this indicate?Can you now say that liquids exert pressure on the walls of the container ? Do gases also exert pressure? Do they also exert pressure on the walls of their containers? Let us find out.fixed to the glass tube bulge this time? Pour some more water in the bottle. Is there any change in the bulge of the rubber sheet? Fig. 8.16 : Liquids exert equal pressure at the same depth I have seen fountains of water coming out of the leaking joints or holes in pipes supplying water . Is it not due to the pressure exerted by water on the walls of the pipes? When you inflate a balloon, why do you have to close its mouth? What happens when you open the mouth of an inflated balloon? Suppose you have a balloon which has holes. W ould you 2024-25 SCIENCE 106 Unit area Fig. 8.17 : Atmospheric pressure is the force of gravity on air in a column of unit areabe able to inflate it? If not, why? Can we say that air exerts pressure in all directions? Do you recall what happens to the air in the bicycle tube when it has a puncture? Do these observations suggest that air exerts pressure on the inner walls of an inflated balloon or a tube? So, we find that gases, too, exert pressure on the walls of their container . 8.10 Atmospheric Pressure You know that ther e is air all ar ound us. This envelop of air is known as the atmosphere . The atmospheric air extends up to many kilometres above the sur face of the earth. The pressure exerted by this air is known as atmospheric pressur e . We know that pressure is force per unit area. If we imagine a unit area and a very long cylinder standing on it filled with air , then the force of gravity on the air in this cylinder is the atmospheric pressure (Fig. 8.17). Fig. 8.18 : A rubber sucker pressed on a surface When you pr ess the sucker , most of the air between its cup and the sur face escapes out. The sucker sticks to the surface because the pr essure of atmosphere acts on it. To pull the sucker off the sur face, the applied for ce should be large enough to overcome the atmospheric pressure. This activity might give you an idea about the magnitude of atmospheric pressure. In fact, it would not be possible for any human being to pull the sucker off the But, how large or small is the atmospheric pressure? Let us get an idea about its magnitude. Activity 8.11 Take a good quality rubber sucker . It looks like a small rubber cup (Fig. 8.18). Press it hard on a smooth plane sur face. Does it stick to the surface? Now try to pull it of f the surface. Can you do it? 2024-25 FORCE AND PRESSURE 107 If the area of my head were 15 cm  15 cm, how much force air will exert on my head? Fig. 8.19 : Pressure of atmosphere on your headsurface if ther e wer e no air at all between the sucker and the sur face. Does it give you an idea how large the atmospheric pressure is? The force due to air in a column of the height of the atmosphere and area 15 cm  15 cm (Fig. 8.19) is nearly equal to the force of gravity on an object of mass 225 kg (2250N). The reason we are not crushed under this force of gravity is that the pressure inside our bodies is also equal to the atmospheric pressure and balances the pressure from outside. Did you know? Otto von Guericke, a German scientist of the 17th century, invented a pump to extract air out of a vessel. With the help of this pump, he demonstrated dramatically the force of the air pressure. He joined two hollow metallic hemispheres of 51 cm diameter each and pumped air out of them. Then he employed eight horses on each hemisphere to pull them apart (Fig. 8.20). So great is the force of air pressure that the hemispheres could not be pulled apart.

Make sure that its top surface is levelled. Take a wooden or a plastic stool. Cut two strips of graph paper each with a width of 1 cm. Paste them vertically on any leg of the stool - one at the bottom and the other from the top. Now gently put the stool on the sand bed with its legs resting on the sand. Increase the size of sand bed if required. Now put a load, say a school bag full of books, on the seat of the stool. Mark the level of sand on the graph strip. This would give you the depth, if any, to which the legs of stool sink in sand. Next, turn the stool upside down so that now it rests on its seat on the sand bed. Note the depth to which the stool sinks now. Next, put the same load on the stool and note the depth to which it sinks in the sand. Compare the pressure exerted by the stool in the two situations. 2.Take a tumbler and fill it with water. Cover the mouth of the tumbler with a thick card similar to that of a postcard. Hold the tumbler with one hand while keeping the card pressed to its mouth with your other hand. Turn the tumbler upside down while keeping the card pressed to its mouth. Make sure that the tumbler is held vertical. Gently remove the hand pressing the card. What do you observe? Does the card get detached allowing the water to spill? With a little practice you will find that the card continues to hold water in the tumbler even after it is not supported by your hand. Also try this activity by using a piece of cloth to hold the tumbler in an upside down position (Fig. 8.21).

{"chapter": "9", "title": "Chapter 9: 9. Friction", "content": "FRICTIONFRICTION You might have seen a driver of a car or a truck slowing down the vehicle at a traf fic signal. Y ou, too, slow down your bicycle whenever needed by applying brakes. Have you ever thought why a vehicle slows down when brakes are applied? Not only vehicles, any object, moving over the sur face of another object slows down when no external force is applied on it. Finally it stops. Have you not seen a moving ball on the ground stopping after some time? Why do we slip when we step on a banana peel (Fig. 9.1)? Why is it difficult to walk on a smooth and wet floor? Fig. 9.1 : A boy falls down when he steps on a banana peel9.1 Force of Friction Activity 9.1 Gently push a book on a table [Fig. 9.2(a)]. Y ou observe that it stops after moving for some distance. Repeat this activity pushing the book from the opposite direction [Fig. 9.2, (b)]. Does the book stop this time, too? Can you think of an explanation? Can we say that a force must be acting on the book opposing its motion? This force is called the force of friction. Fig. 9.2 (a), (b) : Friction opposes relative motion between the surfaces of the book and the table(a) (b) You will find the answers to such questions in this chapter . 2024-25 You saw that if you apply the for ce along the left, friction acts along the right. If you apply the force along the right, the friction acts along the left direction. In both cases the force opposes the motion of the book. The force of friction always opposes the applied force. In the above activity, the force of friction acts between the sur face of the book and the sur face of the table. Is the friction the same for all the surfaces? Does it depend on the smoothness of the surfaces? Let us find out. 9.2 Factors affecting Friction Activity 9.2 Tie a string ar ound a brick. Pull the brick by a spring balance (Fig. 9.3). You need to apply some for ce. Note down the readi ng on the spring balance when the brick just begins to move. It gives you a measure of the force of friction between the sur face of the brick and the floor .for this difference? Repeat this activity by wrapping a piece of jute bag around the brick. What do you observe? Fig. 9.3 : A brick is being pulled by spring balance Now wrap a piece of polythene around the brick and repeat the activity. Do you observe any difference in the readings of the spring balance in the above two cases? What might be the reasonSpring Balance Spring balance is a device used for measuring the force acting on an object. It consists of a coiled spring which gets stretched when a force is applied to it. Stretching of the spring is measured by a pointer moving on a graduated scale. The reading on the scale gives the magnitude of the force. Activity 9.3 Make an inclined plane on a smooth floor, or on a table. Y ou may use a wooden board supported by bricks, or books. [Fig. 9.4 (a)]. Put a mark with a pen at any point A on the inclined plane. Now let a pencil cell move down from this point. How far does it move on the table before coming to rest? Note down the distance. Now spread a piece of cloth FRICTION 113 2024-25 SCIENCE 114 Fig. 9.5 : Surface irregularitiesover the table. Make sure that there are no wrinkles in the cloth. T ry the activity again [Fig. 9.4 (b)].Does the distance covered depend on the natur e of the sur face on which the cell moves? Could the smoothness of the sur face of the cell also affect the distance travelled by it? (a) (b) Repeat this activity by spreading a thin layer of sand over the table. Maintain the same slope throughout the activity. In which case is the distance covered the minimum? Why is the distance covered by the pencil cell different every time. T ry to r eason why? Discuss the result.Fig. 9.4 : The pencil cell covers different distances on different surfacesI shall try the activity by wrapping a piece of sandpaper around the cell. Friction is caused by the irregularities on the two sur faces in contact. Even those sur faces which appear very smooth have a large number of minute irregularities on them (Fig. 9.5). Irregularities on the two surfaces lock into one another . When we attempt to move any sur face, we have to apply a force to overcome interlocking. On rough sur faces, ther e are a lar ger number of irregularities. So the force of friction is gr eater if a r ough sur face is involved.Mark A Mark A Surface of book Surface of table 2024-25 FRICTION 115 We see that the friction is caused by the interlocking of irregularities in the two sur faces. It is obvious that the for ce of friction will increase if the two surfaces ar e pressed har der. You can experience it by dragging a mat when nobody is sitting on it, and when a preson is sitting on it.friction and you find it somewhat easier to move the box already in motion than to get it started. 9.3 Friction : A Necessary Evil Recall now some of your experiences. Is it easier to hold a kulhar (earthen pot) or a glass tumbler? Suppose the outer surface of the tumbler is greasy, or has a thin layer of cooking oil on it; would it become easier or more difficult to hold it? Just think : would it be possible to hold the glass at all if there is no friction? Recall also how difficult it is to move on a wet muddy track, or wet marble floor. Can you imagine being able to walk at all if there were no friction? You could not write with pen or pencil if there were no friction. When your teacher is writing with chalk on the blackboard, its r ough sur face rubs off some chalk particles which stick to Recall your experience when last time you moved a heavy box from one place to another (Fig. 9.6). If you have no such experience, get that experience now. What is easier  to move the box from rest, or to move it when it is already in motion? The force required to overcome friction at the instant an object starts moving from rest is a measure of static friction. On the other hand, the force required to keep the object moving with the same speed is a measure of sliding friction. When the box starts sliding, the contact points on its sur face, do not get enough time to lock into the contact points on the floor . So, the sliding friction is slightly smaller than the staticFig. 9.7 : A nail is fixed in the wall due to friction Fig. 9.6 : You have to push on the box to keep it moving 2024-25 SCIENCE 116 the black board. Could it happen if there were no friction between the chalk and the board? If an object started moving, it would never stop if there were no friction. Had there been no friction between the tyres of the automobiles and the road, they could not be started or stopped or turned to change the direction of motion. Y ou could not fix a nail on the wall (Fig. 9.7) or tie a knot. Without friction no building could be constructed. Fig. 9.8 : Soles of shoes wear out due to friction Fig. 9.10 : Stricking a matchstick produces fire by friction produces heat. In fact, when a machine is operated, heat generated causes much wastage of energy. W e shall discuss the ways of minimising friction in the following section. Fig. 9.9 : Rubbing of your palms makes you feel warm On the other hand, friction is an evil, too. It wears out the materials whether they are screws, ball bearings or soles of shoes (Fig. 9.8). Y ou must have seen worn-out steps of foot over -bridges at railway stations. Friction can also produce heat. Vigorously rub your palms together for a few minutes (Fig. 9.9). How do you feel? When you strike a matchstick against the r ough sur face, it catches fir e (Fig. 9.10). You might have observed that the jar of a mixer becomes hot when it is runfor a few minutes. Y ou can cite various other examples in which friction 2024-25 FRICTION 117 9.4 Increasing and Reducing Friction As you have seen in the previous section, friction is desirable in some situations. Have you ever thought why the sole of your shoe is grooved [Fig. 9.11 (a)]? It is done to provide the shoes better grip on the floor , so that you can move safely. Similarly, the treaded tyres of cars,trucks and bulldozers provide better grip with the ground.In some situations, however , friction is undesirable and we would want to minimise it. Why do you sprinkle fine powder on the carr om boar d (Fig. 9.12)? Y ou might have noticed that when a few drops of oil ar e pour ed on the hinges of a door, the door moves smoothly. A bicycle and a motor mechanic uses grease between the moving parts of these machines. In all the above cases, we want to reduce Fig. 9.12 : Powder is sprinkled on the carrom board to reduce friction friction in order to increase efficiency. When oil, grease or graphite is applied between the moving part of a machine, a thin layer is formed there and moving surfaces do not dir ectly rub against each other (Fig. 9.13). Interlocking of irregularities is avoided to a great extent. Movement becomes smooth. The substances which reduce friction are called lubricants . In some machines, it may not be advisable to use oil as lubricant. An air cushion between the moving parts is used to reduce friction.We deliberately incr ease friction by using brake pads in the brake system of bicycles and automobiles. When you are riding a bicycle, the brake pads do not touch the wheels. But when you press the brake lever , these pads arr est the motion of the rim due to friction. The wheel stops moving. Y ou might have seen that kabaddi players rub their hands with soil for a better grip of their opponents. Gymnasts apply some coarse substance on their hands to increase friction for better grip.(a) (b) Fig. 9.11 : (a) Soles of shoes and (b) tyres are treaded to increase friction Fig. 9.13 : Action of lubricantSurface 1Surface 2 Lubricant 2024-25 SCIENCE 118 Activity 9.4 Take a few pencils which are cylindrical in shape. Place them parallel to each other on a table. Place a thick book over it (Fig. 9.15). Now push the book. Y ou observe the pencils rolling as the book moves. Do you feel it easier to move the book in this way than to slide it? Do you think that resistance to the motion of the book has been reduced? Have you seen heavy machinary being moved by placing logs under it? 9.5 Wheels Reduce Friction You must have seen attaches and other pieces of luggage fitted with rollers. Even a child can pull such pieces of luggage (Fig. 9.14). Why is it so? Let us find out.Can we reduce friction to zero by polishing surfaces or using large amount of lubricants? Friction can never be entirely eleminated. No surface is perfectly smooth. Some irregularities are always there. Fig. 9.15 : Motion of the book on rollers When one body r olls over the sur face of another body, the resistance to its motion is called rolling friction . Rolling reduces friction. It is always easier to roll than to slide a body over another . That is the reason it is convenient to pull luggage fitted with rollers. Can you now understand why the wheel is said to be one of the greatest inventions of mankind? Since the rolling friction is smaller than the sliding friction , sliding is replaced in most machines by rolling by the use of ball bearings. Common examples are the use of ball bearings between hubs and the axles of ceiling fans and bicycles (Fig. 9.16). Fig. 9.14 : Rolling reduces friction 2024-25 FRICTION 119 9.6 Fluid Friction You know that air is very light and thin. Yet it exerts frictional force on objects moving through it. Similarly, water and other liquids exert force of friction when objects move through them. In science, the common name of gases and liquidsis fluids . So we can say that fluids exert force of friction on objects in motion through them. The frictional force exerted by fluids is also called drag. The frictional force on an object in a fluid depends on its speed with respect to the fluid. The frictional force also depends on the shape of the object and the nature of the fluid. It is obvious that when objects move through fluids, they have to overcome friction acting on them. In this process they lose energy. Efforts are, therefore, made to minimise friction. So, objects are given special shapes. Where do you think scientists get hints for these special shapes? From nature, of course. Birds and fishes have to move about in fluids all the time. Their bodies must have evolved to shapes which would make them lose less energy in overcoming friction. Look carefully at the shape of an aeroplane (Fig. 9.17). Do you find any similarity in its shape and that of a bird? In fact, all vehicles are designed to have shapes which reduce fluid friction.

{"chapter": "10", "title": "Chapter 10: 10. Sound", "content": "SOUNDSOUND How do you come to know that a period is over in your school? You come to know easily that someone is at your door when he knocks or you hear the sound of the doorbell. Most of the time you can make out that someone is approaching you by just hearing the foot steps. You might have played a game called hide and seek. In this game a person is blind-folded and has to catch the remaining players. How is the blind- folded person able to guess which player is closest to her?Sound plays an important role in our lives. It helps us to communicate with one another . We hear a variety of sounds in our surroundings. Make a list of sounds you hear in your surroundings. In the music room of your school you hear the sounds produced by musical instruments like flute, tabla , harmonium, etc. (Fig. 10.1). How is sound produced? How does it travel from one place to another ? How do we hear sound? Why are some sounds louder than others? W e shall discuss such questions in this chapter . Fig. 10.1 : Some musical instrumentsTabla HarmoniumSitar Flute 2024-25 SCIENCE 12410.1 Sound is Produced by a Vibrating Body Touch the school bell when not in use. What do you feel? Again touch it when producing sound. Can you feel it vibrating? Activity 10.1 Take a metal plate (or a pan). Hang it at a convenient place in such a way that it does not touch any wall. Now strike it with a stick (Fig.10.2). Do you hear a sound? Touch the plate or pan gently with your finger . Do you feel the vibrations? Fig. 10.2 : Striking a pan Again strike the plate with the stick and hold it tightly with your hands immediately after striking. Do you still hear the sound? Touch the plate after it stops producing sound. Can you feel the vibrations now?As you learnt in Class VII the to and fro or back and forth motion of an object is called vibration . When a tightly stretched band is plucked, it vibrates and produces sound. When it stops vibrating, it does not produce any sound. Activity 10.3 Take a metal dish. Pour water in it. Strike it at its edge with a spoon (Fig. 13.4). Do you hear a sound? Again strike the dish and then touch it. Can you feel the dish vibrating? Strike the dish again. Look at the sur face of water . Do you see any waves there? Now hold the dish. What change do you observe on the sur face of water? Can you explain the change? Is there a hint to connect sound with the vibrations of a body? Activity 10.2 Take a rubber band. Put it around the longer side of a pencil box (Fig. 10.3). Insert two pencils between the box and the stretched rubber . Now, pluck the rubber band somewhere in the middle. Do you hear any sound? Does the band vibrate? Fig. 10.3 : Plucking the rubber band 2024-25 SOUND 125 We see that a vibrating object produces sound. In some cases, the vibrations are easily visible to us. But in most cases, their amplitude is so small that we cannot see them. However , we can feel them. Activity 10.4 Take a hollow coconut shell and make a musical instrument ektara. You can also make it with the help of an earthen pot (Fig. 10.5). Play this instrument and identify its vibrating part.Table 10.1 : Musical Instruments and their Vibrating Parts S.No. Musical Vibrating Part Instrument Producing Sound 1. Veena Stretched string 2. Tabla Stretched membrane 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. Many of you might have seen the manjira (cymbals), the ghatam, and the noot (mudpots) and the kartal. These musical instruments are commonly used in many parts of our country. These instruments are simply beaten or struck (Fig. 10.6). Can you name a few other musical instruments of this type? You too can make a musical instrument.Fig. 10.4 : Vibrating dish produces waves in water Fig. 10.6 : A few more musical instruments Ghatam Make a list of familiar musical instruments and identify their vibrating parts. A few examples are given in Table 10.1. Complete rest of the Table.Fig. 10.5 : Ektara Manjira 2024-25 SCIENCE 126 10.2 Sound Produced by Humans Speak loudly for a while or sing a song, or buzz like a bee. Put your hand on your throat as shown in Fig. 10.8. Do you feel any vibrations? In humans, the sound is produced by the voice box or the larynx . Put your fingers on the throat and find a hard bump that seems to move when you swallow. This part of the body is known as the voice box. It is at the upper end of the windpipe. Two vocal cords, are stretched across the voice box or larynx in such a way that it leaves a narrow slit between them for the passage of air (Fig.10.8). Fig. 10.7 : Jaltrang When we pluck the string of an instrument, like the sitar , the sound that we hear is not only that of the string. The whole instrument is forced to vibrate, and it is the sound of the vibration of the instrument that we hear. Similarly, when we strike the membrane of a mridangam , the sound that we hear is not only that of the membrane but of the whole body of the instrument.When we speak, does any part of our body vibrate? Fig.10.8 : Voice box in humans When the lungs force air through the slit, the vocal cords vibrate, producing sound. Muscles attached to the vocal cords can make the cords tight or loose. When the vocal cords are tight and thin, the type or quality of voice is differentActivity 10.5 Take 6-8 bowls or tumblers. Fill them with water up to different levels, increasing gradually from one end to the other . Now take a pencil and strike the bowls gently. Strike all of them in succession. Y ou will hear pleasant sounds. This is your jaltrang (Fig.10.7). 2024-25 SOUND 127from that when they are loose and thick. Let us see how the vocal cords function. Activity 10.6 Take two rubber strips of the same size. Place these two pieces one above the other and stretch them tight. Now blow air through the gap between them [Fig. 10.9(a)]. As the air blows through the stretched rubber strips, a sound is produced. You can also take a piece of paper with a narrow slit and hold it between your fingers as shown in Fig. 10.9 (b). Now blow through the slit and listen to the sound. Our vocal cords produce sound in a similar manner . (a) (b) Fig. 10.9 (a), (b) : Working of vocal cor ds The vocal cords in men are about 20 mm long. In women these are about 15mm long. Children have very short vocal cords. This is the reason why the voices of men, women and children are different. 10.3 Sound Needs a Medium for Propagation When you call up your friend who is standing at a distance, your friend is able to hear your voice. How does the sound propagate or travel to her? Activity 10.7 Take a metal or glass tumbler . Make sure that it is dry. Place a cell phone in it. (Remember that the cell phone must not be kept in water .) Ask your friend to give a ring on this cell phone from another cell phone. Listen to the ring carefully. Now, surround the rim of the tumbler with your hands (Fig. 10.10). Put your mouth on the Fig. 10.10 : Sound needs a medium to travel 2024-25 SCIENCE 128Place your ear gently on the water surface (Fig. 10.11). (Be car eful : the water should not enter in your ear .) Can you hear the sound of the bell? Does it indicate that sound can travel through liquids? opening between your hands. Indicate to your friend to give a ring again. Listen to the ring while sucking air fr om the tumbler . Does the sound become fainter as you suck air? Remove the tumbler from your mouth. Does the sound become loud again? Can you think of an explanation? Is it possible that the decreasing amount of air in the tumbler had something to do with decreasing loudness of the ring? Indeed, if you had been able to suck all the air in the tumbler , you will not listen any sound . Actually, sound needs a medium to travel. When air has been removed completely from a vessel, it is said that there is a vacuum in the vessel. The sound cannot travel through a vacuum. Does sound travel in liquids? Let us find out. Activity 10.8 Take a bucket or a bathtub. Fill it with clean water . Take a small bell in one hand. Shake this bell inside the water to produce sound. Make sure that the bell does not touch the body of the bucket or the tub.Oh ! That is how whales and dolphins might be communicating under water . Fig. 10.11 : Sound travelling through waterFig. 10.12 : Sound travelling through a metre scale Can you hear the sound of the scratching? Ask your friends around you if they were able to hear the same sound?Let us find out if sound can travel through solids also. Activity 10.9 Take a metre scale or a long metal rod and hold its one end to your ear. Ask your friend to gently scratch or tap at the other end of the scale (Fig. 10.12). 2024-25 SOUND 129You can also per form the above activity by placing your ear at one end of a long wooden or metallic table and asking your friend to gently scratch the other end of the table (Fig. 10.13). Fig. 10.13 : Sound can travel through solids We find that sound can travel through wood or metal. In fact, sound can travel thr ough any solid. Y ou can perform inter esting activities to show that sound can also travel through strings. Have you ever made a toy telephone (Fig. 10.14). Can you say that sound can travel through strings? Fig. 10.14 : A toy telephone We have lear nt so far that vibrating objects produce sound and it is carried in all directions in a medium. The medium could be a gas, a liquid or a solid. How do we hear it? Fig. 10.15 : Understanding action of an eardrum10.4 We Hear Sound thr ough Our Ears The shape of the outer part of the ear is like a funnel. When sound enters it, it travels down a canal at the end of which there is a thin stretched membrane. It is called the eardrum. It per forms an important function. To understand what the eardrum does, let us build a tin-can model of the eardrum. Activity 10.10 Take a plastic or tin-can. Cut its ends. Stretch a piece of rubber balloon across one end of the can and fasten it with a rubber band. Put four or five grains of dry cereal on the str etched rubber . Now ask your friend to speak Hurrey, Hurrey from the open end (Fig.10.15). Observe what happens to the grain. Why do the grains jump up and down? 2024-25 SCIENCE 130The eardrum is like a stretched rubber sheet. Sound vibrations make the eardrum vibrate (Fig. 10.16). The eardrum sends vibrations to the inner ear. From ther e, the signal goes to the brain. That is how we hear .You have alr eady lear nt in earlier classes about the oscillatory motion and its time period. The number of oscillations per second is called the frequency of oscillation. Frequency is expressed in hertz . Its symbol is Hz. A frequency of 1 Hz is one oscillation per second. If an object oscillates 20 times in one second, what would be its frequency? You can r ecognise many familiar sounds without seeing the objects producing them. How is it possible? These sounds must be different to enable you to recognise them. Have you ever thought what factors make them different? Amplitude and frequency are two important properties of any sound. Can we differentiate sounds on the basis of their amplitudes and frequencies? Loudness and Pitch Activity 10.11 Take a metallic tumbler and a tablespoon. Strike the tablespoon gently at the brim of the tumbler .Fig. 10.16 : Human ear Fig. 10.17 : Thermocol ball touching the vibrating glass tumblerWe must NEVER put a sharp, pointed or hard thing into our ear. It can damage the eardrum. The damaged eardrum can impair hearing. 10.5 Amplitude, T ime Period and Frequency of a Vibration We have lear nt that the to and fr o motion of an object is known as vibration. This motion is also called oscillatory motion .Eardrum Inner ear 2024-25 SOUND 131Hear the sound produced. Now bang the spoon on the tumbler and hear the sound produced again. Is the sound louder when the tumbler is struck hard? Now suspend a small thermocol ball touching the rim of the tumbler (Fig. 10.17). Vibrate the tumbler by striking it. See how far the ball is displaced. The displacement of the ball is a measure of the amplitude of vibration of the tumbler . Now, strike the tumbler gently and then a little har der. Compar e the amplitudes of vibrations of the tumbler in the two cases. In which case is the amplitude larger? Loudness of sound is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the vibration producing the sound. For example, if the amplitude becomes twice, the loudness increases by a factor of 4. The loudness is expressed in a unit called decibel (dB). The following table gives some idea of the loudness of sound coming from various sources. Normal breathing 10 dB Soft whisper (at 5m) 30 dB Normal conversation 60 dB Busy traffic 70 dB Average factory 80 dB Above 80 dB the noise becomes physically painful.I wonder why my voice is different from that of my teacher . Compare the sound of a baby with that of an adult. Is there any difference? Even if two sounds are equally loud, they differ in some way. Let us see how. Fig. 10.18 : Frequency determines the pitch of a soundThe loudness of sound depends on its amplitude. When the amplitude of vibration is large, the sound produced is loud. When the amplitude is small, the sound produced is feeble.The frequency determines the shrillness or pitch of a sound. If the frequency of vibration is higher we say that the sound is shrill and has a higher pitch. If the frequency of vibration is lower , we say that the sound has a lower pitch. For example, a drum vibrates with a low frequency. Therefore, it produces 2024-25 SCIENCE 132a low-pitched sound. On the other hand, a whistle has a high frequency and therefore, produces a sound of higher pitch (Fig. 10.18). A bird makes a high-pitched sound whereas a lion makes a low-pitched r oar. However , the roar of a lion is very loud while the sound of the bird is quite feeble. Every day you hear the voices of children and adults. Do you find any difference in their voices? Can you say that the frequency of the voice of a child is higher than that of an adult? Usually the voice of a woman has a higher frequency than that of a man. 10.6 Audible and Inaudible Sounds We know that we need a vibrating body for the production of sound. Can we hear the sound of all vibrating bodies? The fact is that sounds of frequencies less than about 20 vibrations per second (20 Hz) cannot be detected by the human ear. Such sounds ar e called inau dible. On the higher side, sounds of frequencies higher than about 20,000 vibrations per second (20 kHz) are also not audible to the human ear . Thus, for human ear, the range of audible frequencies is roughly from 20 to 20,000 Hz. Some animals can hear sounds of frequencies higher than 20,000 Hz. Dogs have this ability. The police use high frequency whistles which dogs can hear but humans cannot. The ultrasound equipment, familiar to us for investigating and tracking many medical problems, works at frequencies higher than 20,000 Hz.10.7 Noise and Music We hear dif ferent types of sounds around us. Is the sound always pleasing? Does a sound sometimes cause discomfort to you? Some sounds are pleasant to the ear , wher eas some are not. Suppose construction work is going on in your neighbourhood. Are the sounds coming from the construction site pleasing ? Do you enjoy the sounds produced by horns of buses and trucks? Such unpleasant sounds are called noise . In a classroom, if all the students speak together , what would the sound produced be called? On the other hand you enjoy sounds from musical instruments. Musical sound is one which is pleasing to the ear. Sound pr oduced by a harmonium is a musical sound. The string of a sitar also gives out a musical sound. But, if a musical sound becomes too loud, would it remain melodious ? 10.8 Noise Pollution You alr eady know about air pollution. Presence of unwanted gases and particles in air is called air pollution. Similarly, presence of excessive or unwanted sounds in the environment is called noise pollution. Can you list some sources of noise pollution? Major causes of noise pollution are sounds of vehicles, explosions including bursting of crackers, machines, loudspeakers etc. What sources in the home may lead to noise? Television and transistor radio at high volumes, some kitchen appliances, desert coolers, air conditioners, all contribute to noise pollution. 2024-25 SOUND 133Hearing Impairment Total hearing impairment, which is rare, is usually from birth itself. Partial disability is generally the result of a disease, injury or age. Children with impaired hearing need special care. By learning sign language, such children can communicate effectively. Because speech develops as the direct result of hearing, a child with a hearing loss may have defective speech also. Technological devices for the hearing-impaired have made it possible for such persons to improve their quality of life. Society can do much to improve the living environment for the hearing-impaired and help them live normal lives.What are the Harms of Noise Pollution? Do you know that presence of excessive noise in the surroundings may cause many health related problems. Lack of sleep, hypertension (high blood- pressure), anxiety and many more health disorders may be caused by noise pollution. A person who is exposed to a loud sound continuously may get temporary or even permanent impairment of hearing. Measures to Limit Noise Pollution To control noise, we must control the sources of noise. How can this be achieved? For this, silencing devicesmust be installed in air craft engines, transport vehicles, industrial machines and home appliances. How can the noise pollution be controlled in a residential area? All noisy operations must be conducted away from any residential area. Noise producing industries should be set up away from such areas. Use of automobile horns should be minimi s ed. TV and music systems should be run at low volumes. Trees must be planted along the roads and around buildings to cut down on the sounds reaching the residents, thus reducing the harmful effects of noise pollution. 2024-25 SCIENCE 134 KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS AMPLITUDE EARDRUM FREQUENCY hertz (Hz) LARYNX LOUDNESS NOISE OSCILLA TION PITCH TIME PERIOD VIBRA TION VOICE BOX WIND PIPE WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT \u00dcSound is produced by vibrating objects. \u00dcIn human beings, the vibration of the vocal cords produces sound. \u00dcSound travels through a medium (gas, liquid or solid).

Golconda fort, near Hyderabad, is one of the most magnificient forts in India. It is famous for many engineering and architectural marvels. One of the marvels is the water supply system. But, perhaps, more astonishing is a dome near the entrance to the fort. A hand-clap at a particular point under the dome reverberates and can be heard at the highest point of the fort, about a kilometre away. This was devised as a warning system. If a guard saw a suspicious movement outside the fort, he clapped at the particular point under the dome, and the army inside the fort was alerted to the danger of the approaching enemy. 2024-25"}
{"chapter": "11", "title": "Chapter 11: 11. Chemical Effects of Electric Current", "content": "CHEMICAL EFFECTS OF ELECTRIC CURRENTCHEMICAL EFFECTS OF ELECTRIC CURRENT Your elders might have cautioned you against touching an electrical appliance with wet hands. But do you know why it is dangerous to touch an electrical appliance with wet hands? We have lear nt earlier that the materials, which allow electric current to pass through them, are good conductors of electricity. On the other hand, materials, which do not allow electric current to pass through them easily, are poor conductors of electricity. In Class VI, we made a tester to test whether a particular material allows the electric current to pass through it or not. Do you recall how the tester helped us in deciding that? We found that metals such as copper and aluminium conduct electricity wher eas materials such as rubber ,plastic and wood do not conduct electricity. However , so far we have used our tester to test materials which were in solid state. But what about liquids? Do liquids also conduct electricity? Let us find out. Paheli and Boojho want to remind you that one should not experiment with the electric supply from the mains or a generator or an inverter . Use only electric cells for all the activities suggested here. Fig.11.1 : A tester11.1 Do Liquids Conduct Electricity? To test whether a liquid allows electric current to pass through it or not, we can use the same tester (Fig .11.1). 2024-25 However , replace the cell by a battery. Also, before using the tester we should check whether it is working or not. Activity 11.1 Join the free ends of the tester together for a moment. This completes the circuit of the tester and the bulb should glow. However , if the bulb does not glow, it means that the tester is not working. Can you think of the possible reasons? Is it possible that the connections are loose? Or , the bulb is fused? Or , your cells are used up? Check that all the connections are tight. If they are, then replace the bulb with another bulb. Now test if the tester is working or not. If it is still not working then replace the cells with fresh cells. Now that our tester is working, let us use it to test the various liquids. (Caution: While checking your tester , do not join its free ends for more than a few seconds. Otherwise the cells of the battery will drain very quickly.) Activity 11.2 Collect a few small plastic or rubber caps of discarded bottles and clean them. Pour one teaspoon of lemon juice or vinegar in one cap. Bring your tester over this cap and let the ends of the tester dip into lemon juice or vinegar as shown in Fig. 11.2. Take care that the ends are not more than 1 cm apart but at the same time do not touch each other . Does the bulbFig. 11.2 : Testing conduction of electricity in lemon juice or vinegarof the tester glow? Does lemon juice or vinegar conduct electricity? How would you classify lemon juice or vinegar  a good conductor or a poor conductor? When the liquid between the two ends of the tester allows the electric current to pass, the circuit of the tester becomes complete. The current flows in the circuit and the bulb glows. When the liquid does not allow the electric current to pass, the circuit of the tester is not complete and the bulb does not glow. In some situations even though the liquid is conducting, the bulb may not glow . It may have happened in Activity 11.2 . What can be the reason? Do you remember why the bulb glows when the electric current passes through it? Due to the heating effect of current, the filament of the bulb gets heated to a high temperature and it starts glowing. However , if the current through a circuit is too weak, the filament does not get heated CHEMICAL EFFECTS OF ELECTRIC CURRENT 139 2024-25 SCIENCE 140Activity 11.3 Take the tray from inside a discarded matchbox. W rap an electric wir e a few times around the tray. Place a small compass needle inside it. Now connect one free end of the wire to the terminal of a battery. Leave the other end free. Take another piece of wire and connect it to the other terminal of the battery (Fig. 11 .4). Fig 11.4 : Another testersufficiently and it does not glow. And why is the current in the circuit weak? Well, though a material may conduct electricity, it may not conduct it as easily as a metal. As a result, the circuit of the tester may be complete and yet the current through it may be too weak to make the bulb glow. Can we make another tester which can detect a weak current? We can use another ef fect of an electric current to make another kind of tester . Do you recall that electric current produces a magnetic effect? What happens to a compass needle kept nearby when current flows in a wire? Even if the current is small, the deflection of the magnetic needle can be seen. Can we make a tester using the magnetic effect of currents? Let us find out in Activity 11.3 . Join the free ends of two wires momentarily. The compass needle should show deflection . Your tester with two free ends of the wire is ready. Now repeat Activity 11.2 using this tester . Do you find a deflection in the compass needle the moment you dip the free ends of the tester in lemon juice? Take out the ends of the tester from the lemon juice, dip them in water and then wipe them dry. Repeat the activity with other liquids such as tap water , vegetable oil, milk, honey. (Remember to wash and wipe dry the ends of tester after testing each liquid). In each case observe whether the magnetic needle shows deflection or not. Record your observations in Table 11.1. You may use an LED (Fig. 11.3) in place of the electric bulb in the tester of Fig. 11.2. LED glows even when a weak electric current flows through it. There are two wires (called leads) attached to an LED. One lead is slightly longer than the other . Remember that while connecting to a circuit, the longer lead is always connected to the positive terminal of the battery and the shorter lead is connected to the negative terminal of the battery.

Lemon juice Yes Good Conductor 2. Vinegar 3. Tap W ater 4. Vegetable oil 5. Milk 6. Honey 7. 8. 9. 10. When the free ends of the tester do not touch each other , ther e is an air gap between them. Paheli knows that air is a poor conductor of electricity. But she has also read that during lightning, an electric current passes thr ough air . She wonders if air is indeed a poor conductor under all conditions. This makes Boojho ask whether other materials classified as poor conductors also allow electricity to pass under certain conditions. From Table 11.1, we find that some liquids are good conductors of electricity and some are poor conductors. Actually, under certain conditions most materials can conduct. That is why it is preferable to classify materials as good conductors and poor conductors instead of classifying as conductors and insulators.We have tested the conduction of electricity thr ough tap water . Let us now test the conduction of electricity through distilled water . Activity 11.4 Take about two teaspoonfuls of distilled water in a clean and dry plastic or rubber cap of a bottle. (You may obtain distilled water from your school science lab. Y ou may also get distilled water from a medical store or a doctor or a nurse) . Use the tester to test whether distilled water conducts electricity or not. What do you find? Does distilled water conduct electricity? Now dissolve a pinch of common salt in distilled water . Again test. What do you conclude this time? When salt is dissolved in distilled water , we obtain salt solution. This is a conductor of electricity. The water that we get from sources such as taps, hand pumps, wells and ponds is not pure. It may contain 2024-25 SCIENCE 142several salts dissolved in it. Small amounts of mineral salts are naturally present in it. This water is thus a good conductor of electricity. On the other hand, distilled water is free of salts and is a poor conductor.Most liquids that conduct electricity are solutions of acids, bases and salts. When an electric current flows through a conducting solution, does it produce an effect on the solution? 11.2 Chemical Effects of Electric Current In Class VII, we have learnt some effects of electric current. Can you list these effects? What effect does the current produce when it flows through a conducting solution? Let us find out. Activity 11.6 Take out carbon rods carefully from two discarded cells. Clean their metal caps with sand paper . Wrap copper wires around the metal caps of the carbon rods and join them to a battery (Fig. 1 1.5). W e call these two rods electrodes . (Instead ofSmall amounts of mineral salts present naturally in water are beneficial for human health. However , these salts make water a good conductor . So, we should never handle electrical appliances with wet hands or while standing on a wet floor . We have found that common salt, when dissolved in distilled water , makes it a good conductor . What are the other substances which, when dissolved in distilled water , make it conducting? Let us find out. Caution: Do the next activity under the supervision of your teacherparent or some elderly person, because the use of acid is involved in it. Activity 11.5 Take three clean plastic or rubber caps of bottles. Pour about two teaspoonfuls of distilled water in each of them. Add a few drops of lemon juice or dilute hydrochloric acid to distilled water in one cap. Now in the second cap containing distilled water , add a few drops of a base such as caustic soda or potassium iodide. Add a little sugar to the distilled water in the third cap and dissolve it. Test which solutions conduct electricity and which do not. What results do you obtain? Fig.11.5 : Passing current through water Metal Cap Carbon rod WaterCarbon rod 2024-25 CHEMICAL EFFECTS OF ELECTRIC CURRENT 143Boojho decided to test whether some fruits and vegetables also conduct electricity or not. He cut a potato into two halves and inserted the copper wires of a tester into it. Just then his mother called him and he forgot to take out the wires of the tester inserted into the potato. When he came back after half an hour , he noticed that ther e was a greenish blue spot on the potato around one wire whereas there was no such spot around the other wire (Fig. 11.6).carbon rods, you may take two iron nails about 6 cm lon g.) Pour a cupful of water in a glassplastic bowl. Add a teaspoonful of salt or a few drops of lemon juice to water to make it more conducting. Now immerse the electrodes in this solution. Make sure that the metal caps of the carbon rods are outside the water . Wait for 3-4 minute s. Observe the electrodes carefully. Do you notice any gas bubbles near the electrodes? Can we call the change taking place in the solution a chemical change? Recall the definition of a chemical change that you learnt in Class VII. In 1800, a British chemist, William Nicholson (17531815), had shown that if electrodes were immersed in water , and a current was passed, bubbles of oxygen and hydrogen were produced. Oxygen bubbles formed on the electrode connected to the positive terminal of the battery and hydrogen bubbles formed on the other electrode. The passage of an electric current through a conducting solution causes chemical reactions. As a result, bubbles of a gas may be formed on the electrodes. Deposits of metal may be seen on electrodes. Changes of colour of solutions may occur . The reaction would depend on what solution and electrodes are used. These are some of the chemical effects of the electric current. Fig. 11.6 : Testing potato He was surprised with this observation and along with Paheli repeated this activity many times. They found that it was always the wire connected to the positive terminal, which had a greenish blue spot around it. They felt that this discovery was very useful because it could be used for identifying the positive terminal of a cell or a battery concealed in a box. They decided to report their finding to a childrens magazine. Remember that Boojho set out to test whether potato conducted 2024-25 SCIENCE 144Allow the current to pass for about 15 minutes. Now remove the electrodes from the solution and look at them carefully. Do you find any difference in any one of them? Do you find a coating over it? What colour is the coating ? Note down the terminal of the battery with which this electrode is connected.electricity or not. What he found was that current produced a chemical effect in the potato. To him this was very exciting. In fact, this is how science sometimes works. Y ou ar e looking for something and you discover something else. Many important discoveries have been made in this manner . 11.3 Electroplating You know that a brand new bicycle has shiny handlebar and wheel rims. However , if these ar e accidentally scratched, the shiny coating comes off revealing a not so shiny sur face beneath. You might have also seen women using ornaments, which appear to be made of gold. However , with r epeated use, the gold coating wears off, revealing silver or some other metal beneath. In both these cases, a metal has a coating of another metal. Do you wonder how a layer of one metal can be deposited on top of another? W ell, let us try doing it ourselves. Activity 11.7 We will need copper sulphate and two copper plates of size around 10 cm  4 cm. T ake 250 mL of distilled water in a clean and dry beaker . Dissolve two teaspoonfuls of copper sulphate in it. Add a few drops of dilute sulphuric acid to copper sulphate solution to make it more conducting. Clean copper plates with sand paper . Now rinse them with water and dry them. Connect the copper plate s to the terminals of a battery and immerse them in copper sulphate solution (Fig. 11.7).When electric current is passed through the copper sulphate solution, copper sulphate dissociates into copper and sulphate. The free copper gets drawn to the electrode connected to the negative terminal of the battery and gets deposited on it. But what about the loss of copper from the solution? From the other electrode, a copper plate, an equal amount of copper gets dissolved in the solution. Thus, the After doing the electroplating activity, Paheli interchanged the electrodes and repeated the activity. What do you think she would observe this time? Fig.1 1.7 : A simple circuit showing electroplatingCopper plate Copper sul- phate solutionCopper plate 2024-25 CHEMICAL EFFECTS OF ELECTRIC CURRENT 145 loss of copper from the solution is restored and the process continues . This means that copper gets transferred from one electrode to the other . In the electroplating factories the disposal of the used conducting solution is a major concern. It is a polluting waste and there are specific disposal guidelines to protect the environment.Fig. 11.8 : Some electroplated objects silver and gold on less expensive metals. These ornaments have the appearance of silver or gold but are much less expensive. Tin cans, used for storing food, ar e made by electr oplating tin onto ir on. T in is less reactive than iron. Thus, food does not come into contact with iron and is protected from getting spoilt. Iron is used in bridges and automobiles to provide strength. However , iron tends to corr ode and rust. So, a coating of zinc is deposited on iron to protect it from corrosion and formation of rust. Boojho could get only one copper plate. So he performed Activity 11.7 by connecting a carbon rod in place of the copper plate which was connected to the negative terminal of the battery. He succeeded in obtaining a coating of copper on carbon rod. The process of depositing a layer of any desired metal on another material by means of electricity is called electroplating . It is one of the most common applications of chemical effects of electric current. Electroplating is a very useful process. It is widely used in industry for coating metal objects with a thin layer of a different metal (Fig.11.8). The layer of metal deposited has some desired property, which the metal of the object lacks. For example, chromium plating is done on many objects such as car parts, bath taps, kitchen gas burners, bicycle handlebars, wheel rims and many others. Chromium has a shiny appearance. It does not corrode. It resists scratches. However , chromium is expensive and it may not be economical to make the whole object out of chromium. So the object is made from a cheaper metal and only a coating of chromium over it is deposited.

LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) are available in many colours such as red, green, yellow, blue, white and are increasingly being used for many applications, for example in traffic signal lights. LEDs are increasingly being used for lighting. A cluster of white LEDs grouped together forms a LED light source. LED light sources consume less electricity and have longer lifetime than light bulbs and fluorescent tubes. Hence these are gradually becoming the preferred lighting source.

{"chapter": "12", "title": "Chapter 12: 12. Some Natural Phenomena", "content": "SOME NATURAL PHENOMENA SOME NATURAL PHENOMENA In this chapter we shall discuss two destructive natural phenomena. These are lightning and earthquakes. W e shall also discuss what steps we can take to minimise destruction caused by these phenomena. 12.1Lightning You might have seen sparks on a electric pole when wires become loose. This phenomenon is quite common when wind is blowing and shaking the wires. You might also have seen sparks when a plug is loose in its socket. Lightning is also an electric spark, but on a huge scale. In ancient times, people did not understand the cause of these sparks. They were, therefore, afraid of lightning and thought that the wrath of gods was visiting them. Now, of course, we understand that lightning is caused by the accumulation of charges in the clouds. W e need not be afraid of lightning, but we have to take precautions to protect ourselves from the deadly sparks. The Sparks that the Greeks Knew About The ancient Greeks knew as early as 600 B.C. that when amber (amber is akind of r esin) was rubbed with fur , it attracted light objects such as hair . You might have seen that when you take off woollen or polyester clothes, your hair stands on end. If you take off these clothes in the dark, you even see a spark and hear a crackling sound. In 1752 Benjamin Franklin, an American scientist, showed that lightning and the spark from your clothes are essentially the same phenomena. However , it took 2000 years for this r ealisation to occur . We shall now study some pr operties of electric char ges. W e shall also see how they are related to the lightning in the sky. Let us per form some activities to understand the nature of electric charges. But recall first what you might have played as a game. When you rub I wonder why they took so many years to realise the similarity. Scientific discoveries are a result of hardwork by many people. It can sometimes take a long time. 2024-25 SOME NATURAL PHENOMENA 151 a plastic scale on your dry hair, the scale can attract very small pieces of paper. 12.2 Charging by Rubbing Activity 12.1 Take a used ballpen refill and rub it vigorously with a piece of polythene. Bring it close to small pieces of paper. Take care not to touch the rubbed end of the refill with your hand or with a metallic object. Repeat the activity withsmall pieces of dry leaf, husk and mustard seeds. Record your observations. When a plastic refill is rubbed with polythene, it acquires a small electric charge. Similarly, when a plastic comb is rubbed with dry hair, it acquires a small charge. These objects are called charged objects . In the process of charging the refill and the plastic comb, polythene and hair also get charged. Lets try to charge some other objects that are familiar to you. Table 12.1 Objects Rubbed Materials Attractsdoes not Charged Used for Rubbing Attract Pieces Not Charged of Paper Refill Polythene, woollen cloth Balloon Polythene, woollen cloth, dry hair Eraser Wool Steel spoon Polythene, woollen clothActivity 12.2 Collect the objects and the materials listed in Table 12.1. Try to charge each by rubbing with the materials mentioned in the Table. Record your findings. You can add more items to the Table. 2024-25 SCIENCE 15212.3 Types of Charges and Their Interaction We will select some objects fr om Table 12.1 for the next activity. Activity 12.3 (a) Inflate two balloons. Hang them in such a way that they do not touch each other (Fig. 15.1). Rub both the balloons with a woollen cloth and release them. What do you observe?Rub the other refill also with polythene. Bring it close to the charged refill. Be careful not to touch the charged end with your hand. Is there any effect on the refill in the tumbler? Do the two attract each other , or repel each other? In this activity we have brought close together the charged objects that were made of the same material. What happens if two charged objects made of different materials are brought close to each other? Lets find out. (b) Rub a refill and place it gently in a glass tumbler as before (Fig. 12.3). Bring an inflated charged balloon near the refill and observe. Fig. 12.1 : Like charges repel each other Fig. 12.2 : Interaction between like chargesNow let us repeat this activity with the used pen refills. Rub one refill with polythene. Place it carefully in a glass tumbler using the tumbler as a stand (Fig. 12.2). Fig. 12.3 : Unlike charges attract each other Lets summarise the observations: lA charged balloon repelled a charged balloon. lA charged refill repelled a charged refill. lBut a charged balloon attracted a charged refill. Does it indicate that the charge on the balloon is of a different kind from the charge on the refill? Can we say then, that there are two kinds of 2024-25 SOME NATURAL PHENOMENA 153charges? Can we also say that the charges of the same kind repel each other , while char ges of dif ferent kind attract each other? It is a convention to call the charge acquired by a glass rod when it is rubbed with silk as positive. The other kind of charge is said to be negative. It is observed that when a charged glass rod is brought near a charged plastic straw rubbed with polythene there is attraction between the two. What do you think would be the kind of char ge on the plastic straw? Y our guess, that the plastic straw would carry a negative charge is correct. The electrical charges generated by rubbing are static. They do not move by themselves. When charges move, they constitute an electric current. Y ou have been reading about electric current since Class VI. The current in a circuit which makes a bulb glow, or the current that makes a wire hot, is nothing but a motion of charges. 12.4 Transfer of Char ge Activity 12.4 Take an empty jam bottle. Take a piece of cardboard slightly bigger in size than the mouth of the bottle. Pierce a hole in it so that a metal paper clip can be inserted. Open out the paper clip as shown in Fig. 12.4. Cut two strips of aluminium foil about 4 cm  1 cm each. Hang them on the paper clip as shown. Insert the paper clip in the cardboard lid so that it is perpendicular to it (Fig. 12.4). Charge a refill and touch Fig 12.4 : A simple electroscopeit with the end of the paper clip. Observe what happens. Is there any effect on the foil strips? Do they repel each other or attract each other? Now, touch other charged bodies with the end of the paper clip. Do foil strips behave in the same way in all cases? Can this apparatus be used to detect whether a body is charged or not? Can you explain why the foil strips repel each other? The aluminium foil strips receive the same charge from the charged refill through the paper clip (remember that metals are good conductors of electricity). The strips carrying similar charges repel each other and they become wide open. Such a device can be used to test whether an object is carrying charge or not. This device is known as electroscope . Thus, we find that electrical charge can be transferred from a charged object to another thr ough a metal conductor . Touch the end of the paper clip gently with hand and you will find a change in 2024-25 SCIENCE 154the foil strips. They come back to their original state. Repeat charging of foil strips and touching the paper clip. Every time you will find that the foil strips collapse as soon as you touch the paperclip with hand . Why does it happen? The reason is that the foil strips lose charge to the earth through your body. W e say that the foil strips ar e discharged . The process of transfe rring of charge from a charged object to the earth is called earthing . Earthing is provided in buildings to protect us from electrical shocks due to any leakage of electrical current. 12.5 The Story of Lightning It is now possible to explain lightning in terms of the charges produced by rubbing.During the development of a thunderstorm, the air currents move upward while the water droplets move downward. These vigorous movements cause separation of charges. By a process, not yet completely understood, the positive charges collect near the upper edges of the clouds and the negative charges accumulate near the lower edges. There is accumulation of positive charges near the ground also. When the magnitude of the accumulated charges becomes very large, the air which is normally a poor conductor of electricity, is no longer able to resist their flow. Negative and positive charges meet, producing streaks of bright light and sound. W e see str eaks as lightning (Fig. 12.5). The process is called an electric discharge. Fig. 12.5 : Accumulation of charges leading to lightning. 2024-25 SOME NATURAL PHENOMENA 155 The process of electric discharge can occur between two or more clouds, or between clouds and the earth. Today we need not get frightened by lightning like our ancestors did. Now we understand the basic phenomenon. Scientists are trying hard to improve this understanding. However , lightning strike could destroy life and property. It is, therefore, necessary to take measures to protect ourselves. 12.6 Lightning Safety During lightning and thunderstorm no open place is safe. lHearing thunder is an alert to rush to a safer place. lAfter hearing the last thunder , wait for some time before coming out of the safe place. Finding a Safe Place A house or a building is a safe place. If you are travelling by car or by bus, you are safe inside with windows and doors of the vehicle shut. Dos and Donts during a Thunderstorm Outside Open vehicles, like motorbikes, tractors, construction machinery, open cars are not safe. Open fields, tall trees, shelters in parks, elevated places do not protect us from lightning strokes. Carrying an umbrella is not at all a good idea during thunderstorms. If in a forest, take shelter under shorter trees. If no shelter is available and you are in an open field, stay far away from all trees. Stay away from poles or othermetal objects. Do not lie on the ground. Instead, squat low on the ground. Place your hands on your knees with your head between the hands (Fig. 12.6). This position will make you the smallest target to be struck. Inside the house Lightning can strike telephone cords, electrical wires and metal pipes (Do you remember , lightning is an electrical discharge?). During a thunderstorm contact with these should be avoided. It is safer to use mobile phones and cordless phones. However , it is not wise to call up a person who is receiving your phone through a wired phone. Bathing should be avoided during thunderstorms to avoid contact with running water . Electrical appliances like computer s, TVs, etc., should be unplugged. Electrical lights can remain on . They do not cause any harm.Fig. 12.6 : Safe position during lightning 2024-25 SCIENCE 156Lightning Conductors Lightning Conductor is a device used to protect buildings from the effect of lightning. A metallic rod, taller than the building, is installed in the walls of the building during its construction. One end of the rod is kept out in the air and the other is buried deep in the ground (Fig. 12.7). The rod provides easy route for the transfer of electric charge to the ground. The metal columns used during construction, electrical wires and water pipes in the buildings also protect us to an extent. But do not touch them during a thunderstorm.12.7 Earthquakes You just lear nt about thunderstor m and lightning. These natural phenomena can cause large scale destruction of human life and property. Fortunately, these phenomena can be predicted to some extent. The weather department can warn about a thunderstorm developing in some area. If a thunderstorm occurs there is always a possibility of lightning and cyclones accompanying it. So, we get time to take measures to protect ourselves from the damage caused by these phenomena. Fig. 12.7 : Lightning conductorlightning conductor copper plate 2024-25 SOME NATURAL PHENOMENA 157Ther e is, however , one natural phenomenon which we are not yet able to predict accurately. It is an earthquake. It can cause damage to human life and property on a huge scale. A major earthquake occurred in India on 8 October 2005 in Uri and Tangdhar towns of North Kashmir (Fig. 12.8). Before that a major earthquake occurred on 26 January 2001 in Bhuj district of Gujarat. Activity 12.5 Ask your parents about the huge damage to life and property caused by these earthquakes. Collect a few pictures showing the damagecaused by these earthquakes from newspapers and magazines of those days. Prepare a short report on the suffering of the people during and after the earthquakes. What is an earthquake? What happens when it occurs? What can we do to minimise its effects? These are some of the questions which we shall discuss below. What is an Earthquake? An earthquake is a sudden shaking or trembling of the earth which lasts for a very short time. It is caused by a disturbance deep inside the earths Fig. 12.8 : Kashmir earthquake 2024-25 SCIENCE 158My grandmother told me that the earth is balanced on the horn of a bull and when the bull shifts it to the other horn, an earthquake takes place. How could it be true? crust. Earthquakes occur all the time, all over the earth. They are not even noticed. Major earthquakes are much less frequent. They can cause immense damage to buildings, bridges, dams and people. There can be a great loss to life and property. Earthquakes can cause floods, landslides and tsunamis. A major tsunami occurred in the Indian Ocean on 26 December 2004. All the coastal areas around the ocean suffered huge losses. Activity 12.6 Take an outline map of the world. Locate the eastern coast and Andaman and Nicobar Islands in India. Mark other countries around the Indian Ocean which could have suffered damage. Collect accounts of the devastation caused by the tsunami in India from your parents, or other elders in the family or in the neighbourhood. What Causes an Earthquake? Fig. 12.10 : Earth platesWhat could cause a disturbance inside the earth? Fig. 12.9 : Structure of the earthNow we know that the tremors are caused by the disturbance deep down inside the uppermost layer of the earth called the crust (Fig. 12.9). In ancient times, people did not know the true cause of earthquakes. Their ideas were, therefore, expressed in mythical stories such as the one told by Boojhos grandmother . Similar myths were prevalent in other parts of the world.The outermost layer of the earth is not in one piece. It is fragmented. Each fragment is called a plate (Fig. 12.10). These plates are in continual motion.

It is this disturbance that shows up as an earthquake on the sur face of the earth.carried out. However , most earthquakes are caused by the movement of earths plates. Since earthquakes are caused by the movement of plates, the boundaries of the plates are the weak zones where earthquakes are mor e likely to occur . The weak zones are also known as seismic or fault zones . In India, the areas most thr eatened ar e Kashmir , Wester n and Central Himalayas, the whole of North-East, Rann of Kutch, Rajasthan and the IndoGangetic Plane. Some areas of South India also fall in the danger zone (Fig. 12.12). If scientists know so much about earthquakes, can they also predict when and where the next one will strike? I read somewhere that underground explosions could also cause tremors. Fig. 12.11 : Movements of earths plates Fig. 12.12 : Movements of Indian earths plate The power of an earthquake is expressed in terms of a magnitude on a scale called the Richter scale . Really destructive earthquakes have magnitudes higher than 7 on the Richter scale. Both Bhuj and Kashmir earthquakes had magnitudes greater than 7.5.Although, we know for sure what causes an earthquake, it is not yet possible to predict when and where the next earthquake might occur . Tremors on the earth can also be caused when a volcano erupts, or a meteor hits the earth, or an underground nuclear explosion is Colliding Brushing past 2024-25 SCIENCE 160The tremors produce waves on the surface of the earth. These are called seismic waves. The waves are recorded by an instrument called the seismograph (Fig. 12.13). The instrument is simply a vibrating rod, or a pendulum, which starts vibrating when tr emors occur . A pen is attached to the vibrating system. The pen records the seismic waves on a paper which moves under it. By studying these waves, scientists can construct a complete map of the earthquake, as shown in Fig. 12.14. They can also estimate its power to cause destruction. Fig. 12.13 : A seismographA typical seismograph record Fig. 12.14 : Map of the earthquake EpicentreSeismic wavesFocus Inside the earthEarths Surface Like many other scales in science (decibel is another example), Richter scale is not linear . This means that an earthquake of magnitude 6 does not have one and half times the destructive energy of an earthquake of magnitude 4. In fact, an increase of 2 in magnitude means 1000 times more destructive energy. Therefore, an earthquake of magnitude 6 has thousand times more destructive energy than an earthquake of magnitude 4. Protection against Earthquakes We know fr om the earlier pages that earthquakes cannot be pr edicted. W e have also seen that they can be highly destructive. It is, therefore, important that we take necessary precautions to protect ourselves all the time. Peopleliving in seismic zones, where the earthquakes are mor e likely to occur , have to be specially prepared. First of all, the buildings in these zones should be so designed that they can withstand major tremors. Modern building technology can make it possible.

{"chapter": "13", "title": "Chapter 13: 13. Light", "content": "LIGHTLIGHT The world is largely known through the senses. The sense of sight is one of the most important senses. Through it we see mountains, rivers, trees, plants, chairs, people and so many other things ar ound us. W e also see clouds, rainbows and birds flying in the sky. At night we see the moon and the stars. Y ou are able to see the words and sentences printed on this page. How is seeing made possible? 13.1 What makes Things Visible Have you ever thought how we see various objects? Y ou may say that eyes see the objects. But, can you see an object in the dark? It means that eyes alone cannot see any object. It is only when light from an object enters our eyes that we see the object. The light may have been emitted by the object, or may have been reflected by it. You lear nt in Class VII that a polished or a shiny sur face can act as a mirr or. A mirror changes the direction of light that falls on it. Can you tell in which direction the light falling on a sur face will be reflected? Let us find out. 13.2 Laws of Reflection Activity 13.1 Fix a white sheet of paper on a drawing board or a table. Take acomb and close all its openings except one in the middle. Y ou can use a strip of black paper for this purpose. Hold the comb perpendicular to the sheet of paper . Throw light from a torch through the opening of the comb from one side (Fig. 13.1). With slight adjustment of the torch and the comb you will see a ray of light along the paper on the other side of the comb. Keep the comb and the torch steady. Place a strip of plane mirror in the path of the light ray (Fig. 13.1). What do you observe? After striking the mirr or, the ray of light is reflected in another direction. The light ray, which strikes any sur face, is called the incident ray . The ray that comes back fr om the sur face after reflection is known as the reflected ray .Fig. 13.1 : Arrangement for showing reflection 2024-25 SCIENCE 166 A ray of light is an idealisation. In reality, we have a narrow beam of light which is made up of several rays. For simplicity, we use the term ray for a narrow beam of light. Draw lines showing the position of the plane mirr or, the incident ray and the reflected ray on the paper with the help of your friends. Remove the mirror and the comb. Draw a line making an angle of 90\u00ba to the line representing the mirror at the point where the incident ray strikes the mirr or. This line is known as the normal to the r eflecting sur face at that point (Fig. 13.2). The angleTable 13.1 : Angles of Incidence and Reflection S. Angle of Angle of No. Incidence ( i) Reflection (   r) 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Do you see any relation between the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection. Are they approximately equal? If the experiment is carried out carefully, it is seen that the angle of incidence is always equal to the angle of reflection . This is one of the laws of reflection . Let us per form another activity on reflection. What would happen if I threw the light on the mirror along the normal. Activity 13.2 Perfor m Activity 13.1 again. This time use a sheet of stiff paper or a chart paper . Let the sheet pr oject a little beyond the edge of the Table (Fig. 13.4). Cut the projecting portion of the sheet in the middle. Look at the reflected ray. Make sure that the reflected ray extends to the projected portion of the paper . Bend that part of the projected portion on which the reflected ray falls. Can you still see the reflected ray? Bring the paper back to the original Fig. 13.2 : Drawing the normal Fig. 13.3 : Angle of incidence and angle of reflectionReflected ray NormalIncident raybetween the normal and incident ray is called the angle of incidence (   i). The angle between the normal and the reflected ray is known as the angle of reflection (  r) (Fig. 13.3). Measure the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection. Repeat the activity several times by changing the angle of incidence. Enter the data in Table 13.1. 2024-25 LIGHT 167position. Can you see the reflected ray again? What do you infer?with the S un as the source of light instead of a torch. You, too, can use the Sun as the source of light. These activities can also be performed by making use of the Ray Streak Apparatus (available in the kit prepared by NCER T). Boojho remembered that in Class VII, he had studied some features of the image of an object formed by a plane mirror . Paheli asked him to r ecall those features: (i)Was the image er ect or upside down? (ii)Was it of the same size as the object? (iii)Did the image appear at the same distance behind the mirror as the object was in front of it? (iv)Could it be obtained on a screen? Let us understand a little more about the formation of an image by a plane mirror in the following way: Activity 13.3 A source of light O is placed in front of a plane mirror PQ. Two rays OA and OC are incident on it (Fig. 13.5). Can you find out the direction of the reflected rays? Draw nor mals to the sur face of the mirror PQ, at the points A and C. Then draw the reflected rays at the points A and C. How would you draw these rays? Call the reflected rays AB and CD, respectively. Extend them further . Do they meet? Extend them backwards. Do they meet now? If they meet, mark this point as I. For a viewers eye at E (Fig. 13 .5), do the reflected rays(b) Fig. 13.4 (a), (b) : Incident ray, reflected ray and the normal at the point of incidence lie in the same plane When the whole sheet of paper is spread on the table, it represents one plane. The incident ray, the normal at the point of incidence and the reflected ray are all in this plane. When you bend the paper you create a plane different from the plane in which the incident ray and the normal lie. Then you do not see the reflected ray. What does it indicate? It indicates that the incident ray, the normal at the point of incidence and the reflected ray all lie in the same plane. This is another law of reflection. Paheli and Booj ho per formed the above activities outside the classroom (a) 2024-25 SCIENCE 168appear to come from the point I. Since the reflected rays do not actually meet at I, but only appear to do so, we say that a virtual image of the point O is formed at I. As you have learnt already in Class VII, such an image cannot be obtained on a screen. You may recall that in an image formed by a mirror the left of the object appears on the right and the right appears on the left. This is known as lateral inversion . 13.3 Regular and Diffused Reflection Activity 13.4 Imagine that parallel rays are incident on an irr egular sur face as shown in Fig. 13.6. Remember that the laws of reflection are valid at each point of the sur face. Use these laws to construct reflected rays at various points. Are they parallel to one another? Y ou will find that these rays are reflected in different directions. (Fig. 13.7)When all the parallel rays reflected from a r ough or irr egular sur face ar e not parallel, the reflection is known as diffused or irregular reflection. Remember that the diffused reflection is not due to the failure of the laws of reflection. It is caused by the irregularities in the reflecting sur face, like that of a cardboard. On the other hand , reflection from a smooth sur face like that of a mirror is called regular reflection (Fig. 1 3.8). Images are formed by regular reflection.Fig. 13.5 : Image formation in a plane mirrorFig. 13.6 : Parallel rays incident on an irregular surface Fig. 13.7 : Rays reflected from irregular surface Fig. 13.8 : Regular reflection 2024-25 LIGHT 169Let us find out. 13.4 Reflected Light Can be Reflected Again Recall the last time you visited a hair dresser . Shehe makes you sit in front of a mirr or. After your hair cut is complete, shehe holds a mirror behind you to show you how the hair has been cut (Fig. 1 3.9). Do you know how you could see the hair at the back of your head?Paheli recalls having constructed a periscope as an Extended Activity in Class VI. The periscope makes use of two plane mirrors. Can you explain how reflection from the two mirrors enables you to see objects which are not visible directly? Periscopes are used in submarines, tanks and also by soldiers in bunkers to see things outside. 13.5 Multiple Images You ar e awar e that a plane mirr or for ms only a single image of an object. What happens if two plane mirrors are used in combination? Let us see.Do W e See all Objects due to Reflected Light? Nearly everything you see around is seen due to reflected light. Moon, for example, receives light from the Sun and reflects it. Thats how we see the moon. The objects which shine in the light of other objects are called illuminated objects . Can you name some other such objects? There are other objects, which give their own light, such as the Sun, fire, flame of a candle and an electric lamp. Their light falls on our eyes. That is how we see them. The objects which emit their own light are known as luminous objects. Fig. 13.9 : Mirror at the hair dresser shop I have a question. Can the reflected rays be further reflected if incident on another mirror? 2024-25 SCIENCE 170Activity 13.5 Take two plane mirrors. Set them at right angles to each other with their edges touching (Fig. 13.10). To hinge them you can use adhesive tape. Place a coin in between the mirrors. How many images of the coin do you see (Fig. 13.10)? Now hinge the mirrors using the adhesive tape at different angles, say 45, 60, 120, 180 etc. Place some object (say a candle) in between them. Note down the number of images of the object in each case. Finally, set the two mirrors parallel to each other . Find out how many images of a candle placed between them are formed (Fig. 13.11).Fig. 13.10 : Images in plane mirror at right angle to each other Fig. 13.11 : Image in plane mirror parallel to each other mirrors (a) (b) (c)Can you now explain how you can see the back of your head at the hair dressers shop? This idea of number of images formed by mirrors placed at an angle to one another is used in a kaleidoscope to make numer ous beautiful patter ns. You can also make a kaleidoscope yourself. Kaleidoscope Activity 13.6 To make a kaleidoscope, get three rectangular mirror strips each about 15 cm long and 4 cm wide. Join them together to form a prism as shown in Fig. 13.12(a). Fix this arrangement of mirrors in a circular cardboard tube or tube of a thick chart paper . Make sur e that the tube is slightly longer than the mirror strips. Close one end of the tube by a cardboard disc having a hole in the centre, through which you can see [Fig. 13.12(b)]. To make the disc durable, paste a piece of transparent plastic sheet under the cardboard Fig. 13.12 : Making a kaleidoscope 2024-25 LIGHT 171disc. At the other end, touching the mirrors, fix a circular plane glass plate [Fig. 13.12(c)]. Place on this glass plate several small pieces of coloured glass (broken pieces of coloured bangles). Close this end of the tube by a ground glass plate. Allow enough space for the colour pieces to move around. Your kaleidoscope is r eady. When you peep through the hole, you will be able to see a variety of patterns in the tube. An interesting feature of a kaleidoscope is that you will never see the same pattern again. Designers of wallpapers and fabrics and artists often use kaleidoscopes to get ideas for new patterns. To make your toy attractive, you can wrap the kaleidoscope in a colour ed paper .13.6 Sunlight  White or Coloured In Class VII, you learnt that the sunlight is referred to as white light. Y ou also learnt that it consists of seven colours. Here is another activity (Activity 13.7) showing that sunlight consists of several colours. 13.7 What is inside Our Eyes? We see things only when light coming from them enters our eyes. Eye is one of our most important sense organs. It is, therefore, important to understand its structure and working. The eye has a roughly spherical shape. The outer coat of the eye is white. It is tough so that it can protect the interior of the eye from accidents. Its transparent front part is called Activity 13.7 Fig. 13.13 : Dispersion of lightGet a plane mirror of a suitable size. Place it in a bowl ( katori) as shown in Fig. 1 3.13. Fill the bowl with water . Put this arrangement near a window in such a way that direct sunlight falls on the mirr or. Adjust the position of the bowl so that the reflected light from the mirror falls on a wall. If the wall is not white, fix a sheet of white paper on it. Reflected light will be seen to have many colours. How can you explain this? The mirror and water form aprism. As you learnt in Class VII , this breaks up the light into its colours, Splitting of light into its colours is known as dispersion of light. Rainbow is a natural phenomenon showing dispersion. 2024-25 SCIENCE 172Fig. 13.15 : Demonstration of blind spotCaution : For this activity, never use a laser torch. Activity 13.8 Look into your friends eye. Observe the size of the pupil. Throw light on her eye with a torch. Observe the pupil now. Switch off the torch, and observe her pupil once again. Do you notice any change in the size of the pupil? In which case was the pupil larger? Why do you think it was so? In which case do you need to allow more light in the eye, when the light is dim or bright? Behind the pupil of the eye is a lens which is thicker in the centre. What kind of lens is thicker at the centre? Recall what you learnt about lenses incornea (Fig. 13.14). Behind the cornea, we find a dark muscular structure called iris. In the iris, there is a small opening called the pupil. The size of the pupil is controlled by the iris. The iris is that part of eye which gives it its distinctive colour . When we say that a person has green eyes, we refer actually to the colour of the iris. The iris controls the amount of light entering into the eye. Let us see how. Iris Lens Ciliary muscle Cornea RetinaOptic Nerve Fig. 13.14 : Human eyeClass VII. The lens focuses light on the back of the eye, on a layer called retina (Fig. 13.14). The retina contains several nerve cells. Sensations felt by the nerve cells are then transmitted to the brain through the optic nerve. There are two kinds of cells (i)cones, which are sensitive to bright light and (ii)rods, which are sensitive to dim light. Cones sense colour . At the junction of the optic nerve and the retina, there are no sensory cells, so no vision is possible at that spot. This is called the blind spot . Its existence can be demonstrated as follows: Activity 13.9 Make a round mark and a cross on a sheet of paper with the spot to the right of the cross (Fig. 13.15). The distance between two marks may be 6-8 cm. Hold the sheet of paper at an arms length from the eye. Close your left eye. Look continuously at the cross. Move the sheet slowly towards you, keeping your eye on the cross. What do you find? Does the round mark disappear at some point? Now close your right eye. Look at the round mark now and repeat the activity. Does the cross disappear? The disappearance of the cross or the round mark shows that there is a point on the retina which cannot send messages to the brain when light falls on it. 2024-25 LIGHT 173Nature has provided eyes with eyelids to prevent any object from entering the eye. Eyelids also shut out light when not required. Eye is such a wonder ful instrument that it (normal) can clearly see distant objects as well as objects nearby . The minimum distance at which the eye can see objects distinctly varies with age. The most comfortable distance at which one can read with a normal eye is about 25 cm. Some persons can see objects close to them clearly but cannot see distant objects so clearly. On the other hand, some persons cannot see objects nearby clearly but they can see distant objects quite well. With suitable corrective lenses, these defects of the eye can be corrected. Sometimes, particularly in old age, eyesight becomes foggy. It is due to the eye lens becoming cloudy. When it happens, persons are said to have cataract. There is a loss of vision, sometimes extremely severe. It is possible to treat this defect. The opaque lens is removed and a new artificial lens is inserted. Modern technology has made this procedure simpler and safer . 13.8 Care of the Eyes It is necessary that you take proper care of your eyes. If there is any problem you should go to an eye specialist. Have a regular checkup lIf advised, use suitable spectacles. lToo little or too much light is bad for eyes. Insufficient light causes eyestrain and headaches. Too much light, like that of the Sun, a power fulThe movies that we see are actually a number of separate pictures in proper sequence. They are made to move across the eye usually at the rate of 24 pictures per second (faster than 16 per second). So, we see a moving picture. Front side of cardboardReverse side of cardboardThe impression of an image does not vanish immediately from the retina. It persists there for about 116th of a second. So, if still images of a moving object are flashed on the eye at a rate faster than 16 per second, then the eye perceives this object as moving. Activity 13.10 Get a square piece of cardboard of size 6-8 cm. Make two holes as shown in Fig. 13.16. Thread a string through the two holes. Draw paste a cage on one side of the cardboard and a bird on the other side. Twist the string and make the card twirl rapidly. Do you see the bird in the cage? Fig. 13.16 : Bird in cage 2024-25 SCIENCE 174lamp or a laser torch can injure the retina. lDo not look at the Sun or a power ful light directly. lNever rub your eyes. If particles of dust go into your eyes, wash your eyes with clean water . If there is no improvement go to a doctor . lAlways read at the normal distance for vision. Do not read by bringing the book too close to your eyes or keeping it too far . You lear nt about balanced diet in Class VI. If food is deficient in some components, eyes may also suf fer. Lack of vitamin A in foodstuff is responsible for many eye troubles. Most common amongst them is night blindness. One should, therefore, include in the diet components which have vitamin A. Raw carrots, broccoli and greenDid you know? Animals have eyes shaped in different ways. Eyes of a crab are quite small but they enable the crab to look all around. So, the crab can sense even if the enemy approaches from behind. Butterflies have large eyes that seem to be made up of thousands of little eyes (Fig. 13.17). They can see not only in the front and the sides but the back as well. A night bird (owl) can see very well in the night but not during the day. On the other hand, day light birds (kite, eagle) can see well during the day but not in the night. The owl has a large cornea and a large pupil to allow more light in its eye. Also, it has on its retina a large number of rods and only a few cones. The day birds on the other hand, have more cones and fewer rods.Fig. 13.17 : Eyes of a butterfly Eyes vegetables (such as spinach) and cod liver oil are rich in vitamin A. Eggs, milk, curd, cheese, butter and fruits such as papaya and mango are also rich in vitamin A. 13.9 Visually Impaired Persons Can Read and Write Some persons, including children, can be visually impaired. They have very limited vision to see things. Some persons cannot see at all since birth. Some persons may lose their eyesight because of a disease or an injury. Such persons try to identify things by touching and listening to voices more carefully. They develop their other senses mor e sharply. However , additional resources can enable them to develop their capabilities further . 2024-25 LIGHT 17513.10 What is the Braille System? The most popular resource for visually challenged persons is Braille . Louis Braille Louis Braille, himself a visually challenged person, developed a system for visually challenged persons and published it in 1821.Non-optical and optical aids for visually impaired Non-optical aids include visual aids, tactual aids (using the sense of touch), auditory aids (using the sense of hearing) and electronic aids. Visual aids, can magnify words, can provide suitable intensity of light and material at proper distances. Tactual aids, including Braille writer slate and stylus, help the visually challenged persons in taking notes, reading and writing. Auditory aids include cassettes, tape recorders, talking books and other such devices. Electronic aids, such as talking calculators and computers , are also available for performing many computational tasks. Closed circuit television, also an electronic aid, enlarges printed material with suitable contrast and illumination. Nowadays, use of audio CDs and voice boxes with computers are also very helpful for listening to and writing the desired text. Optical aids include bifocal lenses, contact lenses, tinted lenses, magnifiers and telescopic aids. While the lens combinations are used to rectify visual limitations, telescopic aids are available to view chalkboard and class demonstrations. The present system was adopted in 1932. There is Braille code for common languages, mathematics and scientific notation. Many Indian languages can be read using the Braille system.Braille system has 63 dot patterns or characters. Each character represents a letter , a combination of letters, a common word or a grammatical sign. Dots are arranged in cells of two vertical rows of three dots each. Patterns of dots to represent some English letters and some common words are shown below. These patterns when embossed on Braille sheets help visually challenged persons to recognise words by touching. To make them easier to touch, the dots are raised slightly.Fig. 13.18 : Example of dot patterns used in Braille System 2024-25 SCIENCE 176 Some visually impaired Indians have great achievements to their credit. Diwakar , a child pr odigy has given amazing per formances as a singer . Ravindra Jain, born completely visually impaired, obtained his Sangeet Prabhakar degree from Allahabad. He had shown his excellence as a lyricist, singer and music composer . Lal Advani, himself visually impaired, established an Association for special education and rehabilitation of disabled in India. Besides this, he represented India on Braille problems in UNESCO. Helen A. Keller , an American author and lectur er, is per haps the most well- known and inspiring visually challenged person. She lost her sight when she was only 18 months old. But because of her resolve and courage she could complete her graduation from a university. She wrote a number of books including The Story of my Life (1903).Helen A. KellerVisually impaired people learn the Braille system by beginning with letters, then special characters and letter combinations. Methods depend upon recognition by touching.

(ii)Incident ray, reflected ray and the normal drawn at the point of incidence to the reflecting surface, lie in the same plane. \u00dcImage formed in a plane mirror undergoes lateral inversion. \u00dcTwo mirrors inclined to each other give multiple images. \u00dcBeautiful patterns are formed in a kaleidoscope because of multiple reflections. \u00dcSunlight, called white light, consists of seven colours. \u00dcSplitting of light into its constituent colours is known as dispersion. \u00dcParts of the eye are cornea, iris, pupil, lens, retina and optic nerve. \u00dcA normal eye can see nearby and distant objects clearly. \u00dcVisually impaired persons can read and write using the Braille system. \u00dcVisually impaired persons develop their other senses more sharply to improve their interac- tion with their environment. 2024-25 SCIENCE 178Exercises 1.Suppose you are in a dark room.

Can you explain the basis of the teachers advise? 12.Explain how you can take care of your eyes. 13.What is the angle of incidence of a ray if the reflected ray is at an angle of 90 to the incident ray? 14.How many images of a candle will be formed if it is placed between two parallel plane mirrors separated by 40 cm? 15.Two mirrors meet at right angles. A ray of light is incident on one at an angle of 30 as shown in Fig. 13.19. Draw the reflected ray from the second mirror. Fig. 13.19 16.Boojho stands at A just on the side of a plane mirror as shown in Fig. 13.20. Can he see himself in the mirror? Also can he see the image of objects situated at P , Q and R? Fig. 13.20 17.(a)Find out the position of the image of an object situated at A in the plane mirror (Fig. 13.21). (b)Can Paheli at B see this image? (c)Can Boojho at C see this image? (d)When Paheli moves from B to C, where does the image of A move? Fig. 13.21E X E R C I S E S 2024-25 SCIENCE 180Extended Learning  Activities and Project 1.Make your own mirr or. Take a glass strip or glass slab. Clean it and put it on a white sheet of paper . See yourself in the glass. Next put the glass slab on a black sheet of paper . Again look into the glass. In which case do you see yourself better and why? 2.Make friends with some visually impaired students. Enquire from them how they read and write. Also find out how they are able to recognise objects, hurdles and currency notes. 3.Meet an eye specialist. Get your eye sight checked and discuss how to take care of your eyes. 4.Survey your neighbourhood. Find out how many children below the age of 12 years use spectacles. Find out from their parents what, in their view, could be the reason for the weak eyesight of their children. Did Y ou Know? Eyes can be donated by any person as an invaluable gift to visually impaired persons suffering from corneal blindness, The person may be (a)a male or female. (b)of any age. (c)of any social status. (d)using spectacles. (e)suffering from any normal disease but not AIDS, Hepatitis B or C, rabies, leukemia, lymphoma, tetanus, cholera, encephalitis. The eyes have to be donated within 4-6 hours after death at any place, home or hospital. A person who wants to donate the eyes may pledge eyes during hisher lifetime to any registered eye bank. Heshe should also inform hisher relatives about this pledge so that they can take necessary action after hisher death. You can also donate a Braille kit. 2024-25 Notes 2024-25 Notes 2024-25"}
